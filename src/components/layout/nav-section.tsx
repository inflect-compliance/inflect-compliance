/**
 * Roadmap-12 PR-3 — `<NavSection>` primitive.
 *
 * Groups a set of `<NavItem>`s under an optional section header
 * (Govern / Comply / Manage). The header is the chiselled-in
 * label — unmarkable, quiet, definite — that defines a section
 * without shouting.
 *
 * Why a separate file from `nav-item.tsx`:
 *
 *   - `NavSection` is the parent composition unit; `NavItem` is
 *     the leaf. Keeping them in sibling files makes the contract
 *     boundary obvious — section-level recipe lives here, row-level
 *     recipe lives there.
 *   - Future PRs that polish the section header (R12 doesn't go
 *     further; later UI work might) edit ONE file.
 *
 * Section header recipe (R12-PR3):
 *
 *   - `<span>`, not `<p>`. No default `cursor: text`. Reads as
 *     decorative, not selectable.
 *   - `select-none` belt-and-braces — double-click can't highlight
 *     "Govern" / "Comply" / "Manage".
 *   - `text-[10px]` — one click smaller than the canonical Eyebrow.
 *     The sidebar's typographic hierarchy is row label (14px) >
 *     section header (10px) > app brand (14px). Section header is
 *     a whisper, not a headline.
 *   - `tracking-[0.12em]` — letter-spacing that reads as
 *     "deliberate" not "stretched". 0.1em is too tight, 0.16em
 *     feels overconfident at small sizes.
 *   - `text-content-subtle` — one rung quieter than the page-level
 *     Eyebrow. Section headers are scaffolding; row labels are
 *     content.
 *   - 1px soft gradient hairline above (R13-PR10 evolution from
 *     R12-PR3's flat `border-border-subtle/40`). The divider now
 *     fades in from transparent at the row edges to
 *     `--border-subtle` at center and back to transparent —
 *     `linear-gradient(90deg, transparent, --border-subtle,
 *     transparent)`. The fade reads as breath, not architecture;
 *     section breaks feel like the sidebar inhaling, not as
 *     architectural seams stamped into chrome.
 *     Skipped on the FIRST section so the very top of the sidebar
 *     doesn't pick up an accidental rule.

/**
 * Soft-gradient hairline above the section (skipped on the first
 * section). R13-PR10 replaces the R12-PR3 hard `border-t border-
 * border-subtle/40` with a `::before` pseudo-element carrying a
 * horizontal gradient that fades from transparent at each edge to
 * `--border-subtle` at center.
 *
 * Why not just `border-image: linear-gradient(...)`?
 *   - `border-image` works but doesn't support the `border-style`
 *     alpha tuning we relied on with `/40`. A `::before` overlay
 *     gives full control over both the line's shape and its
 *     opacity profile.
 *
 * Why peak at `--border-subtle` (not `/40`)?
 *   - `--border-subtle` is already alpha-tuned per theme (METRO
 *     navy @ 50%, PwC warm gray @ 60%). The gradient fade at edges
 *     drops effective brightness to ~25-30% at peak — quieter than
 *     R12-PR3's flat ~20%, but the in-and-out fade is what makes
 *     it feel like breath rather than rule.
 *
 * Why absolute-positioned `::before` (not block)?
 *   - The line sits on the wrapper's exact top edge regardless of
 *     content. A `before:block before:h-px` flow-positioned approach
 *     would push content down by 1px on the divided sections only,
 *     creating a 1px alignment drift between first-section
 *     (undivided) and later sections (divided).
