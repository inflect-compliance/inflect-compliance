/**
 * Roadmap-14 PR-1 — `<NavBar>` primitive.
 *
 * The top-bar's only first-class structural element. Every later
 * R14 PR (geometry lock, brand mark, env badge, switcher, search,
 * notifications, user menu, living-chrome polish, mobile parity)
 * edits this file and the slot-children it accepts — never adds
 * a parallel `<header>` elsewhere.
 *
 * Why a separate file:
 *
 *   - Previously `<TopChrome>` (in `TopChrome.tsx`) hand-rolled the
 *     entire `<header>` element + its child layout. It worked, but
 *     it locked the shell shape inside the file that ALSO composes
 *     the breadcrumbs + identity pill. Mixing "what the bar looks
 *     like" with "what the bar shows today" makes every later PR
 *     touch a complex file.
 *
 *   - Hoisting the recipe into one primitive (and exporting the
 *     class strings as named consts) gives R14 a single place to
 *     land every slot. The ratchet
 *     `tests/guards/nav-bar-import-discipline.test.ts` locks the
 *     contract: no parallel `<header role="banner">` with the
 *     load-bearing chrome geometry outside this file.
 *
 * Slot architecture (locked by PR-1, filled by PR-3 onwards):
 *
 *   left      brand mark · env badge · breadcrumbs
 *             (PR-3 adds brand · PR-9 adds env badge ·
 *              breadcrumbs already there in PR-1)
 *
 *   center    global search anchor (⌘K)
 *             (PR-6 adds the search pill)
 *
 *   right     notifications · context · account
 *             (PR-4 swaps identity pill → workspace switcher ·
 *              PR-5 adds user menu · PR-7 adds notifications)
 *
 * Each slot is a discrete React node consumed by the structural
 * shell. The shell is responsible for SPACING and ALIGNMENT only;
 * the slots own their own content + state.
 *
 * Why slot props (not compound components like `<NavBar.Brand/>`)?
 *
 *   - Type-safety: a `left?: ReactNode` prop is just JSX-validated.
 *     A compound-component pattern (`NavBar.Brand = ...`) requires
 *     React.Children sniffing or context plumbing to enforce slot
 *     placement, which adds runtime overhead for zero ergonomic
 *     benefit at this scale.
 *
 *   - Matches the codebase: `<EntityListPage>` and
 *     `<EntityDetailLayout>` (Epic 52 / R13 era) both use slot
 *     props, not compound components. Consistency over fashion.
 *
 *   - SSR-safe: slot props serialize cleanly across the RSC
 *     boundary. Compound components with `displayName` checks can
 *     hit edge cases in production builds.

// ─── Geometry tokens (R14-PR2) ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Five measurements drive how the top-bar feels on the page. Each
// is a named const so the rationale lives next to the value. A
// future "just bump height by 4px" PR has to argue against both
// the doc-comment and the ratchet at
// `tests/guards/r14-nav-bar-geometry-discipline.test.ts`.

/**
 * **64px desktop height.** R14-PR2 bumped this from R2-era 56px
 * (`h-14`). Reasoning: the bar will host a brand mark (32px), a
 * search anchor (28px), a user-avatar button (32px), and a
 * notifications bell (28px) — fitting all four at 56px feels
 * cramped, and the brand mark loses presence next to the
 * breadcrumbs. 64px gives each control an 8px halo of breathing
 * room above + below.
 *
 * `h-16` resolves to 64px in Tailwind's default spacing scale
 * (4px × 16). Pairs cleanly with `NAV_BAR_GAP` (8px) — the
 * horizontal rhythm and the vertical rhythm share a multiple.
 */

/**
 * **16px horizontal padding mobile, 24px desktop.** The bar lives
 * flush with the viewport edges; the left + right padding is the

 * edge. 16px is the minimum that doesn't look amateur; 24px on
 * desktop matches the page-content `md:p-6` so the bar's edges
 * align with the content below it (the eye reads "everything is
 * on the same grid").
 *

 *

 *       `/80` alpha + `backdrop-blur-sm` is the recipe the macOS /
 *       Notion / Linear nav chromes all converge on; doesn't choke
 *       on scrolling content underneath.
 *
 *   (2) `[background-image:radial-gradient(circle at right,
 *       --brand-subtle, transparent 60%)]` — a brand-tinted radial
 *       wash anchored at the right edge (where the user menu
 *       lives). Mirrors R13-PR11's active-row treatment but at the
 *       global chrome level. The right-anchored wash gives the bar
 *       a quiet brand presence without overwhelming the centre
 *       (where the search anchor lives) or the breadcrumbs (left
 *       slot).
 *
 *   (3) The bottom-edge fading-gradient hairline + top-edge gloss
 *       are NOT in this recipe — they live in NAV_BAR_SHELL via
 *       `::before` / `::after` pseudo-elements (R13-PR10 +
 *       R13-PR6 parity, transplanted to the chrome).
 *
 * `border-b border-border-subtle` (R14-PR2 inline form) is RETIRED
 * — the structural ratchet at
 * `tests/guards/r14-nav-bar-geometry-discipline.test.ts` accepts
 * either form (the R14-PR10 evolution is documented inline).

 * with the slot's own hover treatment (brightness / bg-tone shift).
 *
 * Three tokens, each load-bearing:
 *
 *   `transition-transform duration-75 ease-out`
 *       Fast snappy press tempo. 75ms is the snappy zone — fast
 *       enough to feel immediate, long enough to read as motion
 *       rather than teleport. Matches the NavItem press recipe
 *       (R13-PR8) so the chrome + sidebar feel identical to the
 *       hand.
 *
 *   `active:translate-y-px`
 *       1px mousedown drop. CSS `:active` only — hover-translate /
 *       hover-scale stay banned by the local R14 ratchets and the
 *       global motion-language ratchet.
 *
 *   `motion-reduce:active:translate-y-0`
 *       OS-preference safety net. Reduced-motion users see zero
 *       displacement. The tokens.css global only flattens
 *       animation-duration (not static transforms); the explicit
 *       override here is required.
 *
 * R14-PR11 wires this recipe into every clickable chrome slot —
 * brand mark, search anchor (both forms), tenant switcher trigger,
 * notifications bell, user-menu avatar. The shared recipe means a
 * future "let's slow the press to 100ms" PR has ONE place to
 * land — every slot's tactile feel stays coherent.
 *
 * Motion-language exempt: nav-bar.tsx, tenant-switcher.tsx,
 * user-menu.tsx, notifications-bell.tsx, search-anchor.tsx are
 * all added to the EXEMPT_FILES list in
 * `motion-language-discipline.test.ts`. The broadening rationale
 * mirrors R13-PR8's nav-item.tsx exempt: chrome is the canonical
 * place for tactile micro-motion; the bans on hover-translate /
 * hover-scale / hover-shadow still apply within these files via

// ─── Brand mark (R14-PR3) ──────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * **The brand mark recipe.**
 *
 * 22×22 rounded square containing the product's two-letter initials
 * over a 3-stop brand gradient. The visual signature of the chrome.
 *
 * Six load-bearing tokens, each documented:
 *
 *   (1) `h-[22px] w-[22px]` — 22×22 footprint. The compact navbar
 *       control size (stepped 32 → 28 → 22), matched across brand /
 *       bell / user-menu / mobile-menu / tenant-switcher so the
 *       controls read as one tight set within the 64px bar.
 *
 *   (2) `rounded-lg` — 8px corner radius. Parity with `<NavItem>`
 *       and the `<Button>` primitive (both rounded-lg). Mixing
 *       corner radii across primary chrome reads as un-decided.
 *
 *   (3) **3-stop brand gradient at 200% bg-size.** Same hue family
 *       as the R13-PR2 band: `from-default → via-muted → to-emphasis`.
 *       The 200% horizontal size gives the `nav-brand-pulse`
 *       animation room to pan the gradient left → right → left.
 *       The mark visibly "breathes" without geometry change.
 *
 *   (4) `shadow-[var(--nav-band-glow)]` — same outer glow token as
 *       the band (R13-PR2). Coordinates the chrome's two brand
 *       surfaces (brand mark + band on active row) as one piece
 *       of jewellery.
 *
 *   (5) `text-content-inverted text-[11px] font-bold` — the
 *       initials text. Inverted-content (dark on yellow METRO,
 *       white on dark PwC). 11px is the smallest size at which
 *       bold "IC" reads clearly at 32×32 without looking cramped.
 *
 *   (6) `animate-nav-brand-pulse` — the 6s breath. Tempo
 *       deliberately slower than the band's 4s so the eye reads
 *       a hierarchy.
 *
 * Hover treatment: `hover:brightness-110` warms the mark on
 * pointer-over. Filter is not in the motion-language ban list
 * (which targets transform / scale / outer-shadow / translate);
 * brightness is the right tool for "this is clickable, the light
 * just came on".
 *
 * Accessibility:
 *   • `<Link>` with `aria-label` carrying the full product name
 *     + destination ("Inflect Compliance — go to dashboard").
 *   • Visible "IC" initials are `aria-hidden="true"` — they're a
 *     visual signature, not the accessible name.
 *   • `focus-visible:ring-2` for keyboard story (same vocabulary
 *     as `<NavItem>` + `<Button>`).
 *
 * H1-rule carve-out: the R7 `single-h1-per-page` ratchet bans
 * multiple H1s. The brand mark is NOT a heading element — it's a
 * `<Link>` with `aria-label`. The R14-PR3 recipe deliberately
 * avoids `<h1>` to preserve the page-content H1 as the canonical
 * page heading. Documented inline so a future "let's make this an
 * h1 for SEO" PR has to argue against it.
