/**
 * Roadmap-12 PR-1 — `<NavItem>` primitive.
 *
 * The sidebar's only first-class element. Every later Roadmap-12 PR
 * (geometry lock, hover lick, active conviction, focus story, badge,
 * icon discipline) edits the tokens in this file and nowhere else.
 *
 * Why a separate file:
 *
 *   - Previously `NavItem` lived inline at the bottom of
 *     `SidebarNav.tsx`. The tenant sidebar mounts it; the org sidebar
 *     re-implements an almost-identical `OrgNavItem` in
 *     `OrgSidebarNav.tsx`. Two copies of the same recipe.
 *   - Hoisting the recipe into one primitive (and exporting the class
 *     strings as named consts) gives the rest of Roadmap-12 a single
 *     place to land changes. The ratchet
 *     `tests/guards/nav-item-import-discipline.test.ts` locks the
 *     contract: no hand-rolled `<Link>` with the load-bearing
 *     geometry (`min-h-[44px] rounded-lg`) outside this file.
 *
 * State vocabulary (locked by later PRs):
 *
 *   - default       muted text, transparent bg
 *   - hover         emphasis text, bg-muted/50 (R12-PR4 tightens)
 *   - active        emphasis text, brand-subtle bg, brand left-edge
 *   - focus-visible 2px ring at --ring (canonical yellow)
 *
 * The transition is `transition-colors` (motion-language ratchet —
 * duration MUST enumerate the property, never `transition-all`).

/**
 * **The brand-gradient band** — R12-PR5, evolved by R13-PR2.
 *
 * A 3-px wide capsule-shaped pseudo-element pinned to the left of
 * the row. The R12 recipe was a 2-stop gradient (brand-default →
 * brand-emphasis); R13-PR2 evolves this to a **3-stop gradient
 * with a highlight midstop** — like brushed metal lit from above:
 *
 *     top    `--brand-default`  (canonical brand)
 *     middle `--brand-muted`    (one rung lighter — the "highlight")
 *     bottom `--brand-emphasis` (one rung deeper — the "shadow")
 *
 * The eye reads this as a polished metallic capsule with a
 * deliberate highlight bar across its middle. The single-tone
 * "fluid deepening" of R12 was honest but flat; R13-PR2 adds the
 * shape of light hitting the band, which is what "alive" feels
 * like to the eye.
 *
 * Pair with a soft outer glow (`--nav-band-glow` from tokens.css,
 * resolved per theme — yellow @ 35% on METRO, orange @ 35% on
 * PwC). The glow bleeds 6px of brand-coloured light into the row
 * surface, softening the band's edge so it doesn't read as a
 * stamped line. "No rough edges" turns into "the band has an
 * aura".
 *
 * Why a pseudo-element, not a border-left?
 *   - `border-image: linear-gradient(...)` works but doesn't
 *     animate opacity cleanly across browsers.
 *   - A real `<span>` adds DOM weight + a tab-stop edge case.
 *   - Pseudo-element is the canonical CSS recipe for decorative
 *     state signals (no DOM, no a11y noise, full transition
 *     control).
 *
 * Why 6px inset top/bottom (`top-1.5 bottom-1.5`)?
 *   - Full-height rules feel architectural (a divider). A
 *     CAPSULE feels like jewellery. The band reads as a piece of
 *     deliberate ornament, not row chrome.
 *
 * Why opacity 0 → 1 transition (R12-PR5 invariant, preserved)?
 *   - Opacity is the canonical "fade in/out" motion for tone-only
 *     design systems. 200ms ease-out is one rung slower than the
 *     row's colour transition (150ms) so the band feels like it
 *     lights up just AFTER the text wakes — a tiny choreography
 *     the eye doesn't consciously notice but reads as deliberate.
 *
 * The DEFAULT state holds the band at opacity 0 — invisible.
 * The HOVER state fades it to opacity 100 — visible.
 * The ACTIVE state holds it at opacity 100 + adds a brand-subtle
 * background for conviction (see NAV_ITEM_ACTIVE).
 */
/**
 * **The gloss highlight** — R13-PR6.
 *
 * A 1-px tall horizontal line on the `<NavItem>` row's top edge,
 * rendered via the `::after` pseudo-element. Mirrors the way light
 * catches the top edge of a physical raised button. Pinned 8px from
 * each side (`left-2 right-2`) so it doesn't run all the way to the
 * row's corners — keeps the gloss looking like a deliberate
 * highlight rather than a hairline divider.
 *
 * Resolved per theme via `--nav-gloss-highlight`:
 *   METRO  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)  — subtle white catch on navy
 *   PwC    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.70)  — near-white sliver on cream
 *
 * Opacity 0 by default; fades to 100 on hover + active (200ms
 * ease-out — same tempo as the band). Pointer-events disabled so
 * the gloss never intercepts clicks. Geometry is unchanged across
 * states; only opacity moves — preserves R12's motion-language
 * contract (the gloss is opacity + colour, no transform).
 *
 * The gloss is the second `::after`-style decoration the row owns
 * (the band is `::before`). Together they wrap the row in two
 * "lit" edges — the left band signals state, the top gloss signals
 * "raised, ready". Why not a fuller bevel (bottom shadow too)?
 * Because that's PR-7's job — keeping these stacked PRs single-
 * concern.

 * Active state — conviction. (R12-PR6 lock, R13-PR4 evolution.)
 *
 * The active row tells you which page you're on. It has to read

 * quieter. R12-PR6 expressed conviction through four cooperating
 * tokens (text-content-emphasis + brand-subtle bg + opacity-100
 * band + font-medium). R13-PR4 adds a FIFTH dimension: the band's
 * gradient swaps to the SECONDARY brand (cool blue/navy), making
 * the active row visually distinct from any hovered row without
 * shouting.
 *
 * Five cooperating tokens, no single one shouting:
 *
 *   (1) `text-[var(--brand-default)]` (R13-PR5)
 *       Brand-coloured letters: yellow on METRO, orange on PwC.
 *       Held permanently on the active row. The active page is now
 *       visually unmissable from across the desk — the band tells
 *       you WHERE, the brand-coloured label tells you WHAT.
 *       Both themes clear WCAG AA: METRO yellow `#FFCD11` on a
 *       deep-navy + 18%-yellow wash reads at >10:1; PwC orange
 *       `#D04A02` on cream + 9%-orange wash at ~5.5:1.
 *
 *   (2) Radial brand-secondary wash (R13-PR11 evolution)
 *       `bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_left, --brand-secondary-
 *       subtle, transparent 75%)]`. Originally the wash was a
 *       uniform `bg-[var(--brand-subtle)]` (warm primary tint).
 *       R13-PR11 evolved it to a radial gradient ORIGINATING from
 *       the band's left edge, fading to transparent at the right.
 *       The navy radial bleeds out from the band — feels like the
 *       band is leaking light into the row. The wash is now COOL
 *       (matches the band's hue family), not WARM as in R12-PR6;
 *       the warm/cool contrast moved to band-cool + label-warm
 *       (label is `text-[var(--brand-default)]`).
 *
 *   (3) `before:opacity-100 before:animate-nav-band-shimmer`
 *       Band held visible permanently + slow-pulsing.
 *
 *   (4) Secondary-brand band overrides (R13-PR4)
 *       Each stop on the band's 3-stop gradient is overridden with
 *       the `!` important modifier to the brand-secondary
 *       counterpart. The `!` is required: BASE declares the
 *       primary-brand stops; ACTIVE needs to override them with
 *       unambiguous precedence regardless of Tailwind's JIT compile
 *       order. The glow swaps too — `--nav-band-glow-active`
 *       resolves to a navy-coloured 6px blur, so the aura around
 *       the band stays coherent with the band's stops.
 *
 *   (5) `font-medium`
 *       One weight up from regular (400 → 500). Anything bolder
 *       reads as a heading.
 *
 * Visual progression — default → hover → active:
 *   default  no band, muted text, no bg
 *   hover    primary-brand band fades in (warm yellow/orange)
 *            text brightens to content-emphasis
 *   active   primary-brand wash + SECONDARY-brand band (cool)
 *            + BRAND-COLOURED text + font-medium + shimmer pulse
 *

 * `tests/guards/r13-active-band-secondary.test.ts` locks the
 * five secondary-brand override classes + the navy-glow plumbing.

 * Badge recipe — aligned + breathing. (R12-PR8 lock.)

 * Optional count chip (e.g. calendar's upcoming-event count). Five
 * tokens, each carrying its own load:

 *       Pushes the badge to the row's right edge. The icon + label
 *       sit on the left, the badge floats on the right. Margin-auto
 *       (not flex-end) so the label can still occupy the natural
 *       middle space and truncate gracefully when long.
 *
 *   (2) `tabular-nums`
 *       Numerals render at fixed width. A count going 9 → 10 →
 *       99 → 100 doesn't make the badge "pop wider" on every change.
 *       The badge keeps a stable rectangle the eye trusts.
 *
 *   (3) `flex-shrink-0`
 *       The badge MUST NOT be the thing that shrinks when a row's
 *       label is long. The label has `truncate`; the badge is the
 *       fixed counterweight. Without this, on a row like
 *       "Vendor Risk Assessments (47)" with a narrow sidebar, flex
 *       would steal width from the badge too.
 *
 *   (4) `animate-in fade-in`
 *       Tailwindcss-animate's enter animation primitive — opacity
 *       0 → 100 on initial mount. The conditional `{badge != null
 *       && ...}` mounts/unmounts the badge naturally: when a count
 *       first appears (null → 3), the badge fades in. When it
 *       changes value (3 → 4), the element stays mounted and the
 *       animation does NOT re-fire. The entrance is the breath;
 *       updates are silent. Same motion language as the band:
 *       opacity only, no transform / scale / translate.
 *
 *   (5) `duration-300`
 *       The breath has a measured tempo. 300ms is one rung slower
 *       than the band's 200ms — the badge arrives just after the
 *       row finishes settling, which reads as deliberate
 *       choreography rather than competing motion.
 *
 * The badge variant + size + tone are chosen by the JSX, not by
 * this recipe: `variant="info"` (blue, neutral signal — never a
 * brand tone that would compete with the active state's
 * brand-subtle wash) and `size="sm"` (10px text — quiet, doesn't
 * crowd the 14px label or the 18px icon).
