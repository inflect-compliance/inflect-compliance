/**
 * R26-PR-F — Canvas help strip.
 *
 * Dismissible single-line strip below the toolbar that teaches
 * the four canonical interactions a first-time user wouldn't
 * discover on their own:
 *
 *   1. Drag from the palette to add a node.
 *   2. Connect handles to draw an edge manually.
 *   3. Drop a node near another to auto-bind.
 *   4. Click an edge → "Add control" to mount a governance object.
 *
 * Disciplines applied (per the R26-PR-F brief):
 *   • Visible only when needed — auto-hides once the user
 *     dismisses it OR once the canvas has both nodes AND edges
 *     (signals "I've figured it out"). Affordances must not
 *     linger past the moment of need.
 *   • Persistent dismiss — localStorage key + version stamp so
 *     a returning user sees the strip exactly once. Bumping the
 *     stamp resets the dismissal (the few times we'd want to
 *     re-show: when the four interactions evolve).
 *   • Calm tone — single sentence per interaction, separated by
 *     middle dots. No icons (they'd compete with the palette's
 *     icons for attention). No "Got it" button per row.
