/**
 * Card primitive — PR-6 + v2-PR-9.
 *
 * Wraps the legacy `.glass-card` CSS class with two typed axes:
 *
 *   density   — internal padding rung (PR-6):
 *     "comfortable" (default)   p-6   — content cards, panels
 *     "compact"                 p-4   — stat cards, inline cards
 *     "none"                    p-0   — children own padding
 *
 *   elevation — visual depth (v2-PR-9). Four levels expressed via
 *               background tone — never via shadow:
 *     "flat"     — bg-bg-page; matches the page background. Use for
 *                  nested sub-cards inside a `raised` card so the
 *                  inner card reads as part of the outer plane.
 *     "inset"    — bg-bg-subtle (Polish PR-3). Faint tinted surface
 *                  for sub-panels INSIDE a raised/floating parent —
 *                  diff blocks, rich-text editor chrome, evidence
 *                  preview tiles. Reads as "inset into the card" not
 *                  "next card on the same plane".
 *     "raised" (default) — the glass-card recipe (bg-bg-default +
 *                  backdrop-blur + glass border). The standard
 *                  section-level card.
 *     "floating" — bg-bg-elevated. Sits above `raised`; use for
 *                  modal panels, popovers, and active-state surfaces.
 *
 * Why no shadows? Premium products (Linear, Stripe, Vercel) express
 * depth through background-tone changes on dark surfaces, not via
 * box-shadow. Shadows on glass / blurred surfaces look uncertain;
 * tone-based elevation reads as deliberate and quiet.
 *
 * Why keep `.glass-card` underneath? It's the existing visual recipe
 * (backdrop-blur + glass-bg + glass-border) that already paints
 * correctly on both themes. The primitive is a typed wrapper, not a
 * replacement — `raised` (the default) maps directly to it.
