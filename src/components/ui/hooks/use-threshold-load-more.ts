/**
 * PR-1 — Threshold-based "Load more" accumulator for tenant tables.
 *
 * The org-level tables already use `useCursorPagination` for a
 * server-cursor "Load more …" UX. Tenant tables historically render
 * the full result set in one go — fine when row counts are small,
 * but the dashboard's heaviest list pages (controls, risks,
 * evidence, tasks) can balloon past a few hundred rows on busy
 * tenants. That dragged DOM size + scroll cost the user no
 * particular discoverability win.
 *
 * This hook closes the gap WITHOUT requiring every list page to
 * migrate to a paginated API surface (most tenant pages already
 * have the full row set in memory via the existing
 * `LIST_BACKFILL_CAP` cap). It slices the input rows to a
 * threshold-sized window and exposes a `loadMore` action that
 * grows the window in fixed increments.
 *
 *   • If `rows.length <= threshold`, every row is visible from
 *     the start. `hasMore` is `false`, `loadMore` is a no-op.
 *   • If `rows.length > threshold`, only the first `threshold`
 *     rows are visible. `hasMore` is `true`. `loadMore()` adds
 *     `increment` more rows; calling it again reveals the next
 *     batch.
 *   • When the input `rows` shrinks (filters narrow the set) the
 *     visible window stays a single slice, so a narrowed result
 *     never hides the rows the user can see.
 *   • When the input `rows` grows past the current window AFTER a
 *     filter change (filter relaxes back), the window stays at
 *     the user's loaded size — no surprise re-collapse.
 *
 * The hook is purely client-side. The matching org-level cursor
 * pattern lives at `useCursorPagination`; both speak the same UX
 * vocabulary (`hasMore` + `loadMore` + `loading`/`error` on the
 * cursor variant; this variant has no async I/O so no `loading`
 * or `error` state). The shared `<TableLoadMoreFooter>` consumer
 * can render either return shape; see its props for the contract.
