/**
 * R23-PR-B — Shared KPI filter hook.
 *
 * `useKpiFilter` turns a typed list of KPI definitions into the
 * minimum surface a `<KpiFilterCard>` consumer needs:
 *   • `activeKpiId` — which KPI's filter is currently applied, or
 *                     null if none / multiple match.
 *   • `toggle(id)`  — click handler. Activating an inactive KPI
 *                     applies its filter; clicking the active KPI
 *                     clears it.
 *
 * Design — KPI as a typed shortcut over the existing filter context
 *
 * The shared `FilterContextValue` from `@/components/ui/filter`
 * already owns:
 *   - the canonical filter state (Record<string, string[]>)
 *   - URL synchronisation
 *   - search query
 *   - filter pill UI + clearAll behaviour
 *
 * A KPI card is JUST a typed shortcut over that contract — clicking
 * it sets one or more keys to specific values. So the KPI definition
 * encodes (a) how to APPLY the shortcut and (b) how to RECOGNISE
 * whether it's currently active.
 *
 * Two predicate callbacks instead of a `target` shape — flexibility
 * outweighs sugar. Some KPIs map to a single key/value (Open →
 * status=OPEN). Others map to multi-key combinations (Critical →
 * impact=5,4 + likelihood=5,4). The two-callback shape covers both
 * without inflating the type surface.
 *
 * AND-composition with other filters
 *
 * The KPI filter does NOT replace the page's other filter state —
 * it sets keys via the same `ctx.set` / `ctx.add` that user-driven
 * filter dropdowns use. Two consequences:
 *   1. Other filters survive a KPI click (KPI is one dimension of
 *      AND-combined filtering, not a reset).
 *   2. The user can layer filters on top of the KPI shortcut. The
 *      KPI stays "active" as long as its keys match its target
 *      values, regardless of what other filter keys are set.
 *
 * URL sync
 *
 * Free — the underlying `FilterContextValue` URL-syncs all filter
 * state. When a KPI is active, the URL reflects the underlying
 * filter values (?status=OPEN), so reload / share / back-navigation
 * restore the active KPI via `isActive(state)` re-evaluation. R23
 * deliberately does NOT add a separate `?kpi=<id>` URL param — the
 * filter state IS the source of truth.
 *
 * Edge cases
 *
 *   • Multiple matches — if two KPIs both report `isActive(state)`
 *     true (e.g. their target predicates overlap), `activeKpiId`
 *     resolves to null. The page author owns the responsibility of
 *     defining mutually-exclusive KPIs; this hook just reports the
 *     ambiguity rather than picking a winner silently.
 *
 *   • No KPI defined as "all" — a page that wants an All / Total
 *     card defines a KPI whose `apply` is `ctx.clearAll()` and whose
 *     `isActive` is "no filters are set". The hook treats it like
 *     any other KPI; clicking the active "All" card is a no-op
 *     because clearing an empty state is idempotent.
