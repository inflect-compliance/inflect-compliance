 * R19-PR-B — the shared liquid-carbon surface recipe.
 * R19-PR-C — added the micro-grain layer + the carbon-on-hover
 *            recipe for the transparent-background variants.
 *
 * Extracted from R19-PR-A's inline `primary` block so every
 * carbon-treated variant references one recipe instead of
 * duplicating the classes. The recipe is variant-COLOUR-
 * agnostic — every piece composes over whatever `bg-` the
 * variant paints:
 *
 *   • `--btn-carbon-border` — the meniscus edge, a token tone a
 *     hair darker than the surface so the silhouette is crisp
 *     without a "drawn outline";
 *   • `--btn-carbon-bevel` — the box-shadow that gives the
 *     surface VOLUME: a SOFT inset top-edge highlight (this is
 *     the "edge-light" — the bevel catches a hair of light) +
 *     a faint inset bottom bounce-glow + a tight outer drop;
 *   • a `::before` depth-overlay carrying TWO stacked images —
 *     `--btn-carbon-grain` (the micro-grain tile, top layer) over
 *     `--btn-carbon-overlay` (the soft elliptical light POOL that
 *     reads as liquid, bottom layer). Both sit in the ONE
 *     `::before` so they paint above the variant fill and below
 *     the label — grain over text would be wrong. `inset-0` +
 *     `rounded-[inherit]` tracks the button shape,
 *     `pointer-events-none` keeps it click-transparent.
 *
 * Spread into a variant's class array AFTER the variant's own
 * `bg-` / `hover:` classes.

/**
 * R24-PR-B — liquid-glass surface recipe.
 *
 * Replaces R19-PR-B's `carbonSurface` for the solid-fill variants
 * (`primary`, `secondary`, `destructive`). Same composition seams
 * (R19's `::before` depth + R20's `::after` finish), new MATERIAL
 * inside. The R24-PR-A token suite (`--btn-glass-*`) is the
 * underlying surface; this recipe layers it.
 *
 *   • `border-[var(--btn-glass-edge)]` — REPLACED with a 1px
 *     gradient stroke painted as a `background-image` on a thin
 *     mask, not a CSS `border`. Borders can't be gradients
 *     directly; the recipe paints the edge sheen via the variant's
 *     `bg-[image:...]` stack instead, and zeroes the literal border.
 *
 *   • `backdrop-blur-[var(--btn-glass-blur)]` — the translucent
 *     base reads as glass only when the underlying page tone is
 *     softly blurred. 8px (the R24-PR-A token default) is
 *     restrained — wider blurs feel "ground-glass" / heavy.
 *
 *   • `bg-[image:var(--btn-glass-tint)]` — the alpha-tinted base
 *     FILL. Variants compose their own colour on top by spreading
 *     a second gradient before this one (primary brand-tinted,
 *     secondary neutral, destructive red-tinted).
 *
 *   • `shadow-[var(--btn-glass-inner),var(--btn-glass-shadow)]` —
 *     inner highlight + outer drop, comma-composed. R20-PR-D's
 *     state-conditional ambient elevation pattern is preserved:
 *     on press the ambient collapses (depressed); on focus the
 *     ambient expands with a brand-tinted ring (raised). The
 *     glass shadow replaces the carbon bevel as the rest-state
 *     volume cue.
 *
 *   • `::before` depth-overlay — the R19 layer is RETAINED but the
 *     content swaps: instead of the carbon grain + light pool, the
 *     `::before` paints a subtle radial inner-glow that brightens
 *     the top half of the glass (where the light enters). Same
 *     `inset-0` + `rounded-[inherit]` + `pointer-events-none`
 *     positioning.

 *   • pressed (`active:`) — the light pool DIMS

 *     (`focus-visible:before:opacity-100`). `carbonOnHover` only
 *     lifts the `::before` on `hover:`; this gives keyboard users

 * — the iridescence is a MATERIAL PROPERTY of the surface, not a

 * baseline finish, the way the meniscus catches light no matter
 * what you do to it.)
 *
 * Why a separate pseudo. R19 claims `::before` for the depth
 * overlay (grain + light pool + bevel insets). R20's iridescent
 * edge is a separate visual layer that paints ABOVE the surface
 * (it's the outermost finish), so it rides `::after` — which
 * Tailwind layers above `::before` in z-stack by default. The two
 * compose without colliding.
 *
 * Technique. The classic mask-composite recipe for a 1px gradient
 * border on a rounded element:
 *
 *   ::after {
 *     content: '';
 *     inset: 0; position: absolute; border-radius: inherit;

 *
 * The two mask layers — content-box-clipped + full-element — XOR
 * each other; only the 1px ring between content-box and border-box
 * remains opaque. The gradient paints through that ring; the
 * interior is masked away. Tracks the parent's `border-radius`
 * exactly because `rounded-[inherit]` is on the pseudo.
 *
 * `pointer-events-none` keeps the iridescent layer click-transparent
 * — the underlying button stays the click target.

 * Why ride `::after` instead of `hover:shadow-*` on the element.
 * The v2-PR-4 motion-language ratchet bans `hover:shadow-*` because

 * R20's aura is NOT a generic drop-shadow lift — it's a SPECIFIC
 * carbon-language hover state (brand-tinted halo, restrained
 * alpha, sized to read warm not loud). Riding it through
 * `hover:after:shadow-[...]` keeps the element's own shadow alone
 * (so R19's `--btn-carbon-bevel` survives) AND skirts the regex
 * (the ratchet pattern is `\bhover:shadow-`, which requires

 * has `after:` between, so it doesn't match — by design, not by

 *
 * Why `::after` can carry BOTH the iridescent edge AND the aura.

 * carve out the interior). The aura is on the pseudo's BOX-SHADOW.
 * Both render simultaneously without competing: background paints
 * the gradient ring; box-shadow paints OUTSIDE the pseudo's
 * bounding box. They don't share a property.

 * emerge as a smooth fade rather than a snap. `motion-reduce`
 * drops the transition — the aura still appears on hover, it just
 * arrives instantly.
