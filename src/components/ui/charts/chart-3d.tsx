/**
 * Roadmap-21 PR-E — `<Chart3D>` foundation primitive (STUB).
 *
 * ### Status
 *
 * **This is a SCAFFOLD, not a working 3D renderer.** R21-PR-E
 * establishes the API + the architecture but defers the actual
 * `@react-three/fiber` integration because of a compatibility
 * deadlock encountered during landing:
 *
 *   • `@react-three/fiber@9.x` is the React 19-compatible line,
 *     but it introduces a custom JSX runtime that augments the
 *     global `JSX.IntrinsicElements` namespace in a way that
 *     conflicts with vanilla HTML JSX inference under our
 *     tsconfig (`moduleResolution: bundler` + `isolatedModules`
 *     + React 19's `react-jsx` transform). 200+ unrelated TSX
 *     files failed typecheck with "Type 'string' is not
 *     assignable to type 'never'" on every `<div>` / `<button>`.
 *
 *   • `@react-three/fiber@8.x` doesn't pollute JSX globally but
 *     was built for React 18 — its runtime uses the
 *     `ReactCurrentOwner` internal API that React 19 removed, so
 *     the package crashes at module load under React 19.
 *
 * Neither line works under our React 19 setup today. Rather than
 * pin React back to 18 (load-bearing for many other places in
 * the app), R21-PR-E ships the API shape + documentation as a
 * stub. The actual 3D rendering moves to a follow-up roadmap
 * when r3f's React 19 story stabilises.
 *
 * ### What's load-bearing in this PR
 *
 *   - `tokenColor()` — resolves a `--chart-series-${N}-${stop}`
 *     CSS variable to a hex colour string. Works today, no r3f
 *     dependency. Any future 3D renderer (or 2D consumer that
 *     wants a resolved series colour) uses it.
 *
 *   - `Chart3DProps` — the API contract. Locked here so PR-F's
 *     `<BarField3D>` (and any future 3D chart) shapes itself
 *     against the eventual renderer without API churn.
 *
 *   - `useReducedMotion()` — inline `prefers-reduced-motion`
 *     hook. Useful beyond 3D; promote to a shared hook when a
 *     second consumer lands.
 *
 *   - `dynamicChart3D()` — the SSR-safe dynamic-import pattern.
 *     Returns the stub component today; future r3f integration
 *     swaps the inner import without breaking consumers.
 *
 * In the stub state, `<Chart3D>` renders the `FallbackComponent`
 * (when supplied) or a data-attributed placeholder. Consumers
 * can structure their UI against this contract today; the actual
 * r3f-driven scene replaces the inner branch in a follow-up.
