/**
 * TP-2 (task-lifecycle roadmap) — in-app bell notifications for task
 * WATCHERS.
 *
 * `TaskWatcher` add/remove was fully wired (usecase + repo + route + UI)
 * but nothing ever notified a watcher: watching a task delivered nothing.
 * This module fans the three task-activity emitters (comment-add,
 * status-change, assign) out to every watcher.
 *
 * Channel decision — BELL, not per-event email. A watched task can take
 * many comments / status changes in a day; an email per event to every
 * watcher is the notification fatigue that makes people stop watching
 * (the GitHub / Linear default routes watched-item activity to the
 * in-app feed, not the inbox). Email stays reserved for direct
 * assignment — a stronger, lower-frequency signal. The bell is
 * SSE-pushed so a watcher sees the update immediately.
 *
 * Mirrors `assignment.ts`:
 *   - `db.notification.createMany({ skipDuplicates: true })` so a repeated
 *     dedupeKey collapses with NO exception (raw create throws P2002 and
 *     poisons interactive PG transactions).
 *   - Fire-and-forget — the caller isolates this in its own transaction
 *     AFTER the task write commits, so a notification failure never rolls
 *     back the task.
