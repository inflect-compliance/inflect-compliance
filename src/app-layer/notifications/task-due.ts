/**
 * Shared TASK_DUE notification logic.
 *
 * The single writer for in-app `TASK_DUE` notifications, plus the
 * pure window-classification math. It has two consumers:
 *   - the daily `jobs/task-due-notification` cron — the steady-state
 *     scan that catches deadlines drifting near;
 *   - the task usecases (`createTask` / `updateTask` / `assignTask`),
 *     which fire it the instant a near-term deadline is set.
 *
 * It lives in `notifications/`, NOT `jobs/`, on purpose. A usecase
 * importing from `jobs/` couples the HTTP request path to the job
 * module graph; `notifications/` is the neutral shared layer that a
 * job and a usecase may both depend on (it sits beside
 * `notifications/enqueue`, which the task usecase already imports).
 * This module's only import is the Prisma *type* — it pulls nothing
 * into a caller's runtime graph.
 *
 * Reminder windows:
 *   A task is notified when the integer count of calendar days from
 *   "now" to `dueAt` is exactly 7, 1, or 0. Days 2-6 produce nothing.
 *   Calendar-day classification (not millisecond math) means a task
 *   due "tomorrow at 23:00" still reads as the one-day window when
 *   the cron fires at 08:00. The calendar days are counted in the
 *   caller-supplied IANA timezone `tz` (default `'UTC'`) — both the
 *   window classification and the dedupeKey date segment are local
 *   to that zone, so a task due near local midnight is bucketed by
 *   the local calendar day, not the UTC one.
 *
 * Deduplication contract:
 *   `Notification.dedupeKey` is unique. The key is
 *   `{tenantId}:TASK_DUE:{window}:{taskId}:{userId}:{YYYY-MM-DD}`,
 *   where the date is the run-day in the caller-supplied `tz`.
 *   The insert is a `createMany` with `skipDuplicates`
 *   (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) so a repeat — the cron and
 *   the event path overlapping, or two saves the same UTC day — is
 *   absorbed at the SQL layer with NO exception. A task matches at
 *   most one window per run, so over its life a task yields at most
 *   three notifications (7d → 1d → 0d).
