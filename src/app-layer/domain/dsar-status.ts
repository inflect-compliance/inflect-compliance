/**
 * DSAR workflow state machine — pure, dependency-free.
 *
 * Mirrors the shape of `work-item-status.ts`: a transition graph plus a pure
 * checker returning `null` on success and a discriminated error otherwise, so
 * the wording stays identical across every caller.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   RECEIVED    → VERIFIED | REJECTED | CANCELED
 *   VERIFIED    → IN_PROGRESS | REJECTED | CANCELED
 *   IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED | REJECTED
 *   COMPLETED   → (terminal)
 *   REJECTED    → (terminal)
 *   CANCELED    → (terminal)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two things this graph encodes deliberately:
 *
 *   • CANCELED is a distinct terminal state, NOT a REJECTED variant.
 *     "The subject withdrew the request" and "we refused the request" are
 *     different facts to a regulator, and a register that conflates them
 *     answers the wrong question under audit.
 *
 *   • CANCELED is unreachable from IN_PROGRESS. Once fulfilment has begun,
 *     the honest terminal states are COMPLETED (we did it) or REJECTED (we
 *     could not). Retro-cancelling work already performed would misrepresent
 *     what happened.
 *
 * NOTE — actor awareness. `docs/dsar.md` describes VERIFIED → IN_PROGRESS as
 * job-driven. In the manual-fulfilment queue it is admin-driven, and the two
 * will coexist if the automated pipeline (docs/dsar.md Stage 2/3) ever lands.
 * `checkDsarTransition` therefore takes an explicit `actor` so the graph can
 * diverge per-driver without retrofitting later — today both actors share the
 * same edges, and `actor` is recorded rather than restricting.
 *
