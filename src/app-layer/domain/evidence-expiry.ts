/**
 * Evidence expiry — the single definition of "what's expiring".
 *
 * Three surfaces answer that question and they used to answer it three
 * different ways, so the same evidence row could be red on one screen,
 * absent from another, and counted on a third:
 *
 *   - the compliance calendar's evidence loader (no soft-delete or
 *     archive guard at all → showed phantom reviews for deleted rows),
 *   - `DashboardRepository.getUpcomingExpirations` (the ExpiryCalendar list),
 *   - `DashboardRepository.getEvidenceExpiry` (the KPI buckets).
 *
 * Both halves of the definition live here so a future surface inherits
 * them rather than inventing a fourth variant:
 *
 *   1. SCOPE — which rows exist at all for expiry purposes. A
 *      soft-deleted or archived row is gone; showing a review deadline
 *      for it is a phantom.
 *   2. OUTSTANDING — which of those rows still owe someone work.
 *      APPROVED evidence has been reviewed; it no longer owes a review.
 *
 * Note `Evidence.expiredAt` is deliberately NOT part of this: it is
 * stamped at the moment of expiry by the retention job (`retention.ts`
 * sets `expiredAt = now`), so it is a past-tense receipt, not a
 * forward-looking deadline. `nextReviewDate` is the deadline.
