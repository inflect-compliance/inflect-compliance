/**
 * Job Schedules — BullMQ Repeatable Job Definitions
 *
 * Defines the cron patterns and repeatable options for every scheduled job.
 * These are registered once by `scripts/scheduler.ts` and then BullMQ
 * automatically enqueues jobs at the specified cadence.
 *
 * Schedule semantics (preserved from legacy cron docs/comments):
 *   - automation-runner:       every 15 min (control check scheduling)
 *   - daily-evidence-expiry:   daily at 06:00 UTC (sweep + outbox)
 *   - data-lifecycle:          daily at 03:00 UTC (purge + retention)
 *   - policy-review-reminder:  daily at 08:00 UTC (overdue review audit)
 *   - task-due-notification:   daily at 08:00 local (NOTIFICATIONS_TZ) (in-app task deadline reminders)
 *   - retention-sweep:         daily at 04:00 UTC (evidence archival)
 *   - notification-dispatch:   daily at 07:00 UTC (single-pass: monitors + digest dispatch)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: deadline-monitor, evidence-expiry-monitor, and vendor-renewal-check
 * are NOT scheduled independently. They run as part of notification-dispatch
 * to prevent duplicate database scans. They remain registered in the executor
 * registry for ad-hoc/CLI/API use.
 *
 * Times are UTC unless the entry sets a `tz`. BullMQ uses standard
 * cron syntax and evaluates the `pattern` in `tz` when supplied.
 *
