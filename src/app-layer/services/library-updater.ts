/**
 * Library Updater — Version-aware update pipeline with migration strategies.
 *
 * When a framework's YAML changes (new version, added/removed requirements),
 * the updater computes a structural diff and applies a migration strategy
 * to decide how to handle the changes safely.
 *
 * Migration Strategies:
 * ─────────────────────
 * 'preserve'     — Default. Keep existing data, add new requirements,
 *                   deprecate removed ones. No tenant data is lost.
 *
 * 'clamp'        — Like preserve, but if a requirement's score is above
 *                   the new framework's max_score, clamp it down.
 *                   (Prevents invalid scores after framework changes)
 *
 * 'reset'        — Clear all tenant assessment data for changed requirements.
 *                   Used when a framework change is so significant that
 *                   existing assessments are no longer valid.
 *
 * 'rule-of-three' — Only apply updates that have been stable across 3+
 *                    consecutive library versions. Prevents premature
 *                    changes from draft standards.
 *                    When version history is available, uses actual
 *                    multi-version stability analysis. Without history,
 *                    falls back to conservatively suppressing all removals.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * ─────────────
 * The updater is a pure-logic module with no Prisma dependency.
 * It computes diffs and applies strategy transformations, but the
 * actual database writes are handled by the importer.
 *
 * This separation enables:
 * - Unit testing without a database
 * - Strategy composition and chaining
 * - Preview/dry-run capabilities
