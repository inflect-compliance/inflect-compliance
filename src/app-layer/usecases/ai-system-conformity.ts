/**
 * EU AI Act — conformity artifact generation (propose-not-commit).
 *
 * For HIGH-risk AI systems the Act requires conformity artifacts:
 *   - Technical Documentation — Article 11 + Annex IV structure.
 *   - Risk Management record   — Article 9.
 *   - Declaration of Conformity — Article 47 + Annex V structure.
 *
 * This module DRAFTS those documents from the registry data + the system's
 * linked obligations, then routes them through the propose-not-commit approval
 * queue (`createAgentProposal`). A human with write permission reviews and
 * approves before anything becomes a real (DRAFT) policy/document — and even
 * then it is never auto-published. This generator therefore makes NO direct
 * create/publish call to the policy usecase; the CI ratchet
 * (tests/guards/ai-system-registry.test.ts, PROPOSE-NOT-COMMIT) enforces that.
 *
 * A conformity DECLARATION is never auto-issued — issuing conformity is a
 * human legal act.
 *
 * PROVENANCE: document structures are authored from Regulation (EU) 2024/1689
 * (Annex IV, Article 9, Annex V). Nothing derives from any third-party source.
