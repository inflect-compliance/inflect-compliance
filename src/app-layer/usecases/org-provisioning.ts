/**
 * Hub-and-spoke organization auto-provisioning engine (Epic O-2).
 *
 * An ORG_ADMIN inherits full tenant ADMIN on every child tenant of the
 * org (changed from the original read-only AUDITOR — an org admin is a
 * customer administrator who operates their tenants, not just audits
 * them). Three lifecycle entry points keep that relationship coherent:
 *
 *   1. `provisionOrgAdminToTenants(orgId, userId)`
 *      Fan-out on ORG_ADMIN add. For every tenant in the org, create
 *      an ADMIN `TenantMembership` tagged with `provisionedByOrgId`.
 *
 *   2. `provisionAllOrgAdminsToTenant(orgId, tenantId)`
 *      Fan-out on tenant add. For every existing ORG_ADMIN of the
 *      org, create the same ADMIN membership in the new tenant.
 *
 *   3. `deprovisionOrgAdmin(orgId, userId)`
 *      Fan-in on ORG_ADMIN remove. Delete ONLY rows tagged with this
 *      org's id (and whose role is ADMIN — defence-in-depth). Manual
 *      memberships (provisionedByOrgId = NULL) and rows from a
 *      different org survive untouched.
 *
 * ## Idempotency
 *
 * Both fan-out functions use `createMany({ skipDuplicates: true })`.
 * The unique constraint that drives the conflict is the existing
 * `@@unique([tenantId, userId])` on TenantMembership. Skipping on
 * conflict means:
 *   - Re-running the fan-out is a no-op.
 *   - A pre-existing manual ADMIN/EDITOR/READER row is preserved
 *     (never overwritten with ADMIN).
 *   - A pre-existing auto-provisioned row from this same org is left
 *     in place.
 *
 * Deprovision uses `deleteMany` — naturally idempotent (zero rows
 * matching the predicate is a successful no-op).
 *
 * ## Why no RLS bypass
 *
 * These functions cross tenant boundaries (one ORG_ADMIN add fans out
 * to N tenants). They run on the global Prisma client, which Postgres
 * sees as the `postgres` role. The `superuser_bypass` policy on
 * `TenantMembership` (`USING (current_setting('role') != 'app_user')`)
 * fires here and grants access — that's the legitimate privileged
 * path. RLS is not turned off; the role just isn't `app_user`. Same
 * pattern as `tenant-invites.ts:redeemInvite`.
 *
 * ## Why no audit emission inside the service
 *
 * Audit attribution requires a `tenantId` and a request context, but
 * these operations are inherently cross-tenant and are usually
 * triggered from an org-level API route. The caller (which owns the
 * org-level `OrgContext`) is the right place to emit a single org-
 * level audit event summarising the fan-out, plus optional per-tenant
 * audit rows if desired. The service returns rich result metadata so
 * the caller has everything it needs.
 *
 * ## Allowlist
 *
 * This file is the seventh allowlisted membership-creation site.
 * Registered in `tests/guardrails/no-auto-join.test.ts` so a future
 * "where does this membership row come from?" audit reads exactly
 * this file.
