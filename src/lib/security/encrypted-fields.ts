/**
 * # Performance expectations (Epic B.1 — pinned by perf test)
 *
 * Measured in `tests/unit/encryption-middleware.perf.test.ts`. These
 * are the numbers that matter for production sizing — reach for the
 * runbook (`docs/epic-a-security.md` cross-references this layer) if
 * a regression investigation needs them.
 *
 * | Scenario                                     | Observed | Threshold |
 * |----------------------------------------------|---------:|----------:|
 * | Raw `encryptField` / `decryptField`          |  <10 µs |     100 µs|
 * | Single-row detail (3 fields)                 |  <0.1 ms|       5 ms|
 * | List of 100 rows × 2 encrypted fields        |   ~3 ms |      50 ms|
 * | List + 10 nested comments per row (1000 ops) |  ~16 ms |     120 ms|
 * | Write with nested `createMany` of 50         | ~0.8 ms |      80 ms|
 * | Walk 100 rows of a NON-encrypted model       |  <0.5 ms|      15 ms|
 * | Middleware overhead vs raw decrypt (100×2)   |     17% |      100% |
 *
 * **Expected overhead:** ~15–20% above bare AES-GCM cost on realistic
 * list workloads. The traversal + per-value guard (`isEncryptedValue`)
 * fits comfortably inside the headroom of a typical request, and the
 * fast-path early-exit on nodes with no manifest field names means
 * included `User` / `Tenant` / framework-library relations cost
 * almost nothing (a single `Set.has` per node).
 *
 * **Where encryption overhead is acceptable:**
 *   - Every tenant-scoped API route — decryption of N×M fields per
 *     response is bounded by the network-response-size budget, which
 *     dominates the total latency.
 *   - Background jobs (compliance digest, evidence expiry sweeps) —
 *     they tolerate higher per-row cost because they don't affect
 *     request latency.
 *   - PDF exports — one-shot, operator-tolerant.
 *
 * **Where it should be watched:**
 *   - Very large list pages (10k+ rows) — paginate, don't fetch all.
 *     Current cursors in `@/lib/pagination` already cap at 100.
 *   - Dashboards that aggregate across an encrypted column — don't.
 *     Move aggregation to a plaintext analytics column (e.g.
 *     `Risk.score` / `Risk.status`) per the manifest's "fields
 *     explicitly excluded" section.
 *
 * # Epic B.1 — Encrypted field manifest.
 *
 * Lists business-content fields that the Prisma encryption middleware
 * (`src/lib/db/encryption-middleware.ts`) encrypts at rest. The manifest
 * drives encrypt-on-write and decrypt-on-read; no other code path
 * should consult these columns without going through the middleware.
 *
 * Pattern: **in-place encryption**. Unlike the PII middleware
 * (`src/lib/security/pii-middleware.ts`) which uses dual `*Encrypted`
 * sibling columns, the Epic B business-content fields are encrypted
 * into the same column that holds the plaintext today.
 *
 *   - No schema change required to ship the middleware. Existing
 *     rows stay plaintext until their next update (at which point the
 *     middleware rewrites them as ciphertext).
 *   - The one-shot backfill migration (later Epic B phase) iterates
 *     every row and `encryptField()`s each listed field in place.
 *   - Detection is idempotent: every ciphertext begins with the
 *     `v1:` version prefix (see `encryption.ts`). The middleware
 *     uses `isEncryptedValue()` before both encrypt and decrypt so
 *     double-encryption and plaintext-during-rollout are both safe.
 *
 * **Fields DELIBERATELY NOT in this manifest:**
 *   - PII fields (email, name, phone, tokens) — already handled by
 *     `pii-middleware.ts` with the dual-column convention.
 *   - `Risk.description`, `Policy.description`, `Evidence.content` —
 *     searched via `contains` LIKE in their repositories. A product
 *     decision on whether to sacrifice substring search for
 *     encryption is still pending. If ever added here, the
 *     RiskRepository / PolicyRepository / EvidenceRepository search
 *     branches must be removed in the same PR.
 *   - Operational keys (status, category, severity, FKs, dates) —
 *     load-bearing for filters, joins, and indexes.
 *   - Global library tables (Framework, Clause, ControlTemplate,
 *     PolicyTemplate, QuestionnaireTemplate, RiskTemplate) — no
 *     tenant-specific content, zero breach value.
 *   - `AuditLog.*` — append-only hash-chained audit trail. Encrypting
 *     would break `entryHash` integrity; investigation needs
 *     plaintext anyway.
 *
 * **Per-tenant keys (later Epic B phase):** the manifest shape is
 * stable across that change; only the envelope emitted by
 * `encryptField()` grows a `<tenantKeyId>` slot. The version prefix
 * in the ciphertext discriminates — readers keep working.
 */

/**
 * Map from Prisma model name → list of string fields to encrypt.
 * Field names match the Prisma schema exactly.
 *
 * Adding a new field requires:
 *   1. Append to the list here.
 *   2. Verify it's not used in a `contains` / `startsWith` /
 *      `orderBy` in any repository. If it is, either move the
 *      repository off the search (preferred) or skip this field.
 *   3. Extend `tests/unit/encryption-middleware.test.ts` with a
 *      write-then-read round-trip assertion for the new field.
 *   4. Backfill existing rows as a follow-up migration before the
 *      next tenant writes to the column.
