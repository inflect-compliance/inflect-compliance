/**
 * Resolve the PUBLIC origin (`scheme://host`) for building absolute
 * redirect URLs from a Node-runtime route handler.
 *
 * Behind the production reverse proxy (Caddy), `req.nextUrl.origin`
 * resolves to the app's INTERNAL bind address (e.g.
 * `https://0.0.0.0:3000`) — a browser that follows such a redirect
 * lands on an unreachable URL. The Edge middleware doesn't hit this
 * because Next rebuilds its request URL from the forwarded host; Node
 * route handlers must reconstruct the public origin explicitly.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. `X-Forwarded-Host` (+ `X-Forwarded-Proto`) — what the client
 *      actually requested, set by the proxy. Same signal the Edge
 *      middleware uses.
 *   2. The configured public URL (`NEXTAUTH_URL` / `AUTH_URL`).
 *   3. `req.nextUrl.origin` — last resort (dev / no proxy).
