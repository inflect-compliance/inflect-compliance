/**
 * GAP-18 — Plan-entitlement evaluation and enforcement.
 *
 * The full operator + developer runbook is in `docs/billing.md`.
 * This docblock is the inline summary; deviations from it should
 * be reflected in both places.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. Decide what plan a tenant is currently entitled to. The
 *      decision branches on billing mode:
 *
 *        • SAAS mode      — STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is configured, so
 *                            the deployment is the hosted product.
 *                            The effective plan is read from
 *                            `BillingAccount.plan` (FREE/TRIAL/PRO/
 *                            ENTERPRISE). A tenant with no
 *                            BillingAccount row is treated as FREE
 *                            — that's the safe default for a SaaS
 *                            tenant that hasn't started a subscription.
 *
 *        • SELFHOSTED mode — STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is NOT configured,
 *                            so the deployment is on-prem / OSS.
 *                            Every tenant resolves to ENTERPRISE
 *                            (unlimited). Self-hosted customers
 *                            paid for the right to run the software;
 *                            they did not buy a SaaS subscription.
 *
 *      The mode decision is deterministic per process — read once
 *      at module load, no per-request env scan. There is no
 *      runtime flip; restart the process to change modes.
 *
 *   2. Enforce per-plan resource limits at the mutation boundary.
 *      `assertWithinLimit(ctx, resource)` throws a typed
 *      `forbidden(...)` error when the tenant has reached the
 *      cap for `resource` under its effective plan. Reusable —
 *      adding a new gated resource is one entry in `PLAN_LIMITS`,
 *      one `switch` arm in `getCurrentCount`, and one
 *      `assertWithinLimit` call at the create site.
 *
 * NON-GOALS in this module:
 *   • UI gating — the UI is welcome to render upgrade CTAs derived
 *     from the same evaluation, but enforcement must live behind
 *     the API. The UI is advisory; this layer is authoritative.
 *   • Stripe checkout / portal logic — that lives in `src/lib/stripe.ts`.
 *   • Subscription lifecycle hooks — those live in the webhook
 *     handler and write `BillingAccount.plan`. This module READS
 *     that value; it does not write it. Status (CANCELED, PAST_DUE,
 *     …) is also intentionally NOT factored in here — second-
 *     guessing the webhook would race with it and produce confusing
 *     user-facing failures.
