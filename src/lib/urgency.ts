/**
 * Deadline urgency — one threshold set for the whole product.
 *
 * "Due soon" used to mean three different numbers depending on which
 * screen you were looking at:
 *
 *   - the compliance calendar          → ≤7d  ("due_soon")
 *   - the dashboard ExpiryCalendar     → ≤7d urgent, ≤14d upcoming
 *   - the dashboard evidence KPI       → 7d / 30d buckets
 *
 * So the same deadline could be "This Week" on one card, inside the
 * ≤30d bucket on another, and merely "scheduled" on a third. The
 * concept is one concept; it gets one definition.
 *
 * This module is intentionally framework-free — no React, no Prisma —
 * because both halves of the stack consume it: the server classifies
 * calendar events and shapes KPI date-range queries from these numbers,
 * and the client renders tone/labels from them.

/**
 * Day thresholds, in ascending order of distance.
 *
 *   - `URGENT`   — inside a week. Act now.
 *   - `UPCOMING` — inside a month. On the radar, not yet urgent.
 *
 * Anything past `UPCOMING` is "scheduled"; anything before now is
 * "overdue". `UPCOMING` is 30 rather than 14 so it lines up with the
 * dashboard's existing ≤30d evidence bucket and the natural "this
 * month" reading — the 14-day variant on the ExpiryCalendar was the
 * odd one out and had no separate meaning anywhere else.
