/**
 * Pure filter helpers for the command-palette entity-type chips.
 *
 * The chips narrow the rendered subset of an existing
 * `SearchHit[]` payload (no refetch when chips toggle — the
 * server already returned all kinds in one call). Keeps the chip
 * interaction snappy and the request count flat.
 *
 * Helpers are GENERIC over any object that carries a kind
 * discriminator under a caller-chosen accessor, so callers using
 * either the canonical `SearchHit.type` shape OR the legacy
 * `EntitySearchResult.kind` adapter shape get the same logic.
 *
 * Active-filter semantics:
 *
 *   - `activeKinds.size === 0` (NO chips selected) → show ALL
 *     types. Equivalent to "filter is off". This avoids a
 *     "click All to see anything" footgun.
 *   - `activeKinds.size > 0` → show only those types. A chip
 *     showing 0 hits in the current result set still toggles
 *     normally (the user might be widening to include something
 *     that isn't there yet — chip count refreshes on next
 *     search).
