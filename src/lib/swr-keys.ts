/**
 * Epic 69 — typed SWR cache-key registry.
 *
 * Single source of truth for every tenant-scoped SWR cache key the
 * client uses. Without this, adoption of `useTenantSWR` /
 * `useTenantMutation` is one good-intentions PR away from drift —
 * three components writing `/controls`, `/control`, `/Controls` and
 * none of them invalidating each other.
 *
 * Convention
 * ──────────
 *
 *   - Keys are TENANT-RELATIVE paths starting with `/`. The
 *     `/api/t/{slug}` prefix is added by `useTenantSWR` /
 *     `useTenantMutation` from the active TenantContext, so the
 *     same registry entry produces a different cache entry per
 *     tenant naturally.
 *
 *   - Every resource exposes `list()` and (where the API has a
 *     detail route) `detail(id)`. Sub-views are named methods
 *     beneath the resource (`controls.dashboard()`,
 *     `tasks.metrics()`, …) — never deeply nested objects, never
 *     a generic templating DSL.
 *
 *   - Methods return the literal string. The return type is
 *     deliberately `string` — readable, drops straight into the
 *     hook arg list, and composes with the `invalidate: string[]`
 *     option on `useTenantMutation`.
 *
 *   - `CACHE_KEYS` is `as const`, so IDE autocomplete shows every
 *     resource and every method on a single keystroke.
 *
 * Adding a new resource
 * ─────────────────────
 *
 *   1. Either reuse `makeResource('<base>')` for the standard
 *      list + detail pair, OR spell out the methods if the
 *      resource is irregular (no list, multiple detail keys, …).
 *   2. Spread sub-resource methods alongside if the resource has
 *      named views (`{ ...makeResource('x'), summary: () => '/x/summary' }`).
 *   3. NEVER hand-write `/api/t/${slug}/<path>` in a client
 *      component again — reach for `CACHE_KEYS.<resource>.<verb>()`
 *      and let the hook layer prefix.
 *
 * Non-goals (deliberate)
 * ──────────────────────
 *
 *   - This module does NOT do query-string assembly. Pages with
 *     filterable lists pass an extra path suffix or a query
 *     string to the hook directly — collapsing every filtered
 *     view into the registry would explode the surface.
 *   - This module does NOT carry the absolute URL. Keys must work
 *     for any tenant the user is currently scoped to; resolving
 *     them is the hook's job.
 *   - This module does NOT export hooks. It is data only — pages
 *     compose `CACHE_KEYS.<x>.<y>()` with `useTenantSWR` /
 *     `useTenantMutation` themselves.

/**
 * Type alias for tenant-relative cache keys — every method below
