/**
 * DSAR (Data Subject Access Request) — constants + pure decision logic.
 *
 * GDPR Art. 15 (export) + Art. 17 (erasure). This module is the
 * dependency-free core of the DSAR workflow: the rejection criteria, the
 * cooling-off + export-TTL windows, the audit-action names, and the pure
 * `evaluateDsarRejection` decision (unit-testable without a DB).
 *
 * FOUNDATION (Stage 1): execution (export bundle, erasure cascade) is NOT
 * wired — see src/app-layer/jobs/dsar-export.ts + dsar-erasure.ts and the
 * multi-PR sequence in docs/dsar.md.
