/**
 * Aggregation cache registry — the single source of truth for which
 * entities invalidate which dashboard/metric aggregation, and how long
 * each may go stale.
 *
 * Background. List reads are cached by `cachedListRead` keyed on a
 * single entity's version (`src/lib/cache/list-cache.ts`). Dashboards
 * are a different problem: each aggregates ACROSS several entities, so a
 * write to ANY of them must invalidate the cached aggregate. This
 * registry names that dependency graph; `cachedAggregationRead` composes
 * the version counters of every entity in `dependsOn` into one cache key,
 * so a `bumpEntityCacheVersion(ctx, <entity>)` on any dependency makes
 * the next aggregate read recompute.
 *
 * Invalidation correctness (the load-bearing invariant): every entity
 * listed in any `dependsOn` MUST be bumped by at least one usecase after
 * it mutates — otherwise the aggregate never refreshes when that entity
 * changes, except via the TTL safety net. The ratchet
 * `tests/guardrails/aggregation-cache-coverage.test.ts` enforces this.
 *
 * Entity names are the lowercase version-counter identifiers shared with
 * the list cache (a Control write bumps `'control'`, which invalidates
 * BOTH the controls list cache AND every aggregation that depends on
 * `'control'`). Sub-entities roll up to a coarse counter where the write
 * path already bumps it — e.g. a control↔evidence link bumps `'evidence'`
 * + `'control'`, so `controls-dashboard` depending on `'control'` +
 * `'evidence'` covers `ControlEvidence` writes without a separate counter.
