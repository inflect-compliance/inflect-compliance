/**
 * GET /api/invites/:token/start-signin
 *
 * Sets a short-lived HttpOnly cookie carrying the invite token, then
 * redirects the user to /login. After the user completes OAuth, the
 * signIn callback reads the cookie and calls redeemInvite to create
 * their TenantMembership.
 *
 * This is the entry point for the "Sign in to accept" flow on the
 * /invite/:token page. The invite preview page links here instead of
 * directly to /login so the token is never exposed in the URL or
 * referrer header after the OAuth round-trip.
 *
 * Cookie spec:
 *   - HttpOnly — JS cannot read it; prevents XSS exfiltration
 *   - SameSite=Lax — survives the OAuth top-level cross-origin redirect
 *   - Secure in production — HTTPS only
 *   - Max-Age=600 (10 min) — the user has time to complete OAuth
 *   - Path=/ — must be visible to the signIn callback at /api/auth/*
 *
 * The cookie is single-use in effect (redeemInvite burns the token on
 * the first call) so a leaked cookie cannot be exploited after the
 * invite is consumed.
