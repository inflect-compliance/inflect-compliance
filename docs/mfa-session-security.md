# MFA & Session Security — Architecture & Operations Guide

## Overview

Epic 4 implements tenant-level MFA enforcement, TOTP enrollment, session revocation, and brute-force protections. All features are tenant-scoped with server-side enforcement only.

## Architecture

```
Login → JWT callback → check tenant MFA policy
 ├─ DISABLED → full access
 ├─ OPTIONAL + enrolled → mfaPending=true → challenge
 ├─ OPTIONAL + not enrolled → full access
 └─ REQUIRED → mfaPending=true → challenge

Middleware intercepts tenant routes when mfaPending=true
 ├─ Pages → redirect to /t/[slug]/auth/mfa
 ├─ APIs → 403 "MFA verification required"
 └─ MFA/auth routes → allowed (exempt)

Session revocation uses sessionVersion increment strategy
 └─ JWT callback detects stale token → forces re-auth
```

## MFA Policy Modes

| Policy | Not Enrolled | Enrolled (verified) | Admin Protection |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **DISABLED** | Full access | Full access | None needed |
| **OPTIONAL** | Full access | Challenge at login | — |
| **REQUIRED** | Redirect to enrollment | Challenge at login | Anti-lockout check |

## TOTP Enrollment

- **Algorithm**: RFC 6238 (SHA-1, 30s step, 6 digits)
- **Crypto**: Pure Node.js `crypto` — no external TOTP library
- **Storage**: AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets, HKDF-derived keys from `AUTH_SECRET`
- **Never logged**: TOTP codes, secrets, otpauth URIs

### Enrollment Flow
1. `POST /security/mfa/enroll/start` → generates secret, returns `otpauthUrl` + `secret`
2. User scans QR or copies setup key into authenticator app
3. `POST /security/mfa/enroll/verify` → verifies first code, marks enrollment as verified
4. On next login, if policy requires → challenge page

## Session Revocation

**Strategy**: JWT `sessionVersion` field. Each revocation increments `User.sessionVersion` in the database. The JWT callback compares the token's version against the DB on every request; stale tokens force re-authentication.

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Access | Audit Event |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `POST /security/sessions/revoke-current` | Self | `CURRENT_SESSION_REVOKED` |
| `POST /security/sessions/revoke-user` | Admin | `SESSIONS_REVOKED_FOR_USER` |
| `POST /security/sessions/revoke-all` | Admin | `ALL_TENANT_SESSIONS_REVOKED` |

## Brute-Force Protection

### MFA Challenge Verify
- **Limit**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Lockout**: 5 minute lockout after exhaustion
- **Reset**: On successful verification

### MFA Enrollment Verify
- **Limit**: 10 attempts per 15 minutes
- **No lockout** (enrollment is less sensitive than login-time challenge)

### Implementation
In-memory sliding-window rate limiter (`src/lib/security/rate-limit.ts`). For multi-instance deployments, swap to Redis-backed limiter.

## Anti-Lockout Safeguards

### REQUIRED Policy Guard
When enabling REQUIRED MFA policy, the system verifies at least one admin in the tenant has a verified TOTP enrollment. This prevents all admins from being locked out.

**Error**: `"Cannot enable REQUIRED MFA: at least one admin must be enrolled in MFA first."`

### Break-Glass Recovery
- Local login remains accessible for SSO-bypass if configured
- Admin can always downgrade policy from REQUIRED → OPTIONAL → DISABLED
- Session revocation does not affect login ability (login page is public)

## Audit Events

These are the audit events actually emitted today (via `logEvent`):

| Event | When | Emitted from |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `MFA_CHALLENGE_PASSED` | Successful login-time MFA challenge | `mfa-challenge.ts` |
| `MFA_CHALLENGE_FAILED` | Failed login-time MFA challenge | `mfa-challenge.ts` |
| `CURRENT_SESSION_REVOKED` | User revokes own sessions | session-revoke routes |
| `SESSIONS_REVOKED_FOR_USER` | Admin revokes a user's sessions | session-revoke routes |
| `ALL_TENANT_SESSIONS_REVOKED` | Admin revokes all tenant sessions | session-revoke routes |

**Safety**: Audit details never contain TOTP codes, secrets, session tokens, or otpauth URIs.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Used for TOTP secret encryption (AES-256-GCM with HKDF) |
| `NODE_ENV` | Controls secure cookie flags |

## Routes Reference

### Admin Routes
| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/t/[slug]/admin/security` | Security settings page (MFA policy + session management) |

### User Routes
| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/t/[slug]/security/mfa` | MFA enrollment and status |
| `/t/[slug]/auth/mfa` | MFA challenge page (during login flow) |

### API Routes
| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| GET | `/security/mfa/policy` | Read tenant MFA policy |
| PUT | `/security/mfa/policy` | Update tenant MFA policy (admin) |
| POST | `/security/mfa/enroll/start` | Start TOTP enrollment |
| POST | `/security/mfa/enroll/verify` | Verify enrollment code |
| GET | `/security/mfa/enroll` | Get enrollment status |
| DELETE | `/security/mfa/enroll` | Remove enrollment |
| POST | `/security/mfa/challenge/verify` | Login-time TOTP challenge |
| POST | `/security/sessions/revoke-current` | Revoke own sessions |
| POST | `/security/sessions/revoke-user` | Revoke user sessions (admin) |
| POST | `/security/sessions/revoke-all` | Revoke all tenant sessions (admin) |

## Future Work (Non-Blocking)

- **Backup codes**: Not implemented. Add as an alternative 2FA method when the user loses their authenticator. Requires schema addition and separate verify flow.
- **Redis rate limiting**: Current in-memory limiter works for single-instance. For HA/multi-instance, replace with Redis-backed sliding window.
- **QR code rendering**: Challenge page shows a setup key and QR icon placeholder. Add a real QR code library (e.g., `qrcode`) for better enrollment UX.
- **Admin MFA enrollment reset**: Let admins reset a user's MFA enrollment (for lost device recovery). Currently users must contact admin to downgrade policy.
- **Enrollment + policy audit events**: the action names `MFA_ENROLLMENT_STARTED`, `MFA_ENROLLED`, `MFA_ENROLLMENT_VERIFY_FAILED`, and `MFA_POLICY_CHANGED` are reserved but NOT yet emitted — `mfa-enrollment.ts` and `mfa.ts` currently make no `logEvent` calls. Wire `logEvent` into the enrollment start/verify/remove and policy-update paths so these surface in the audit trail alongside the challenge + session-revoke events above.
