# Processes canvas — semantic graph language

The Processes canvas (Manage → Processes) is not a generic diagram editor. It is a
domain-specific surface for **business + IT process documentation with governance
context**. This document records the design commitments that make it so —
how the visual vocabulary maps to the IC domain, and the rules a future
contributor should not break without a good reason.

## Three levels of visual distinction

Every node on the canvas reads at three levels:

1. **Category** (Roadmap-26 PR-D) — `flow` / `context` / `note`. Controls the
   surface tone:
   - `flow` nodes carry a solid surface tint. They ARE the process.
   - `context` nodes carry a muted, more transparent surface. They
     ANNOTATE the process.
   - `note` is a flat sticker. It is not part of the graph at all.

2. **Shape** (R26-PR-B) — `rect` / `diamond` / `note`. Three shapes total. A
   diamond is universally a branch point; a note is universally a sticker;
   everything else is a rectangle.

3. **Accent + icon** — per-kind colour-coding and icon. The accent
   distinguishes one rectangular context node from another (risk = warning
   amber, asset = success green, external = subtle/dashed).

## The seven canonical kinds

| Kind | Category | Shape | Accent | Icon | In palette? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `processStep` | flow | rect | brand | Box | ✅ |
| `decision` | flow | diamond | neutral | GitBranch | ✅ |
| `control` | context | rect | brand-secondary | ShieldCheck | ❌ (edge-only) |
| `risk` | context | rect | warning | AlertTriangle | ✅ |
| `asset` | context | rect | success | FileText | ✅ |
| `external` | context | rect | subtle (dashed) | Globe | ✅ |
| `annotation` | note | note | subtle | StickyNote | ✅ |

## Why control is **edge-first**

Controls in IC are governance objects that GATE a transition between two
process steps. The Roadmap-25 brief committed to representing them ON the
connection (`<ControlOnEdge>` overlay) rather than as standalone nodes
floating beside the flow. R26-PR-D enforces that commitment:

- Controls are no longer offered in the palette. The canonical entry point
  for adding a control is the **"Add control"** affordance that appears when
  the user selects an edge with no existing control.
- The `control` taxonomy entry stays in `NODE_TAXONOMY` so legacy map data
  (R25 + R26-PR-A/B/C era) carrying `nodeType: 'control'` still rehydrates
  correctly. The kind renders identically to other context nodes when it
  appears; we just don't surface it as a primary affordance for NEW maps.

A future PR is free to re-introduce a "node-style control" pattern if a
strong use case emerges. The bar for re-adding it to the palette is high —
edge-mounted is the architecturally chosen canonical surface.

## Why risks and assets stay as nodes

Risks and assets describe **what** a step touches; they are first-class
entities in IC (their own list pages, detail pages, lifecycle). On the
canvas they remain nodes because:

- A risk often has its own attention story (severity, owner, treatment plan)
  worth surfacing on the canvas.
- An asset often appears as the data store / system / document the step
  acts upon — calling it out visibly tells the reader "this step writes
  to this asset" without needing to read the step's prose.

To keep the canvas from competing with the flow, both kinds are rendered
with the **context surface tone** (lower opacity, dashed-or-light border)
so the eye reads them as ANNOTATIONS on the flow, not as PARTS of the flow.

## Why external is dashed

The dashed border on external-party nodes is a long-standing universal
visual convention for "outside the org". One quick look and the reader knows
"this step is performed by them, not us" without needing to read the label.

## What this document is NOT

This is not a developer setup guide. For the persistence layer see
`prisma/schema/processes.prisma` + the R26-PR-A implementation note. For
the palette + taxonomy implementation see `node-taxonomy.ts`. For the
proximity auto-bind interaction see `use-proximity-auto-bind.ts`.

This document is purely the design rationale future contributors need to
NOT accidentally undo when "tidying up" the canvas.
