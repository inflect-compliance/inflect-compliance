# Data Retention Policy

**Status:** DRAFT — engineering inventory complete; retention *numbers*
await legal / compliance / finance sign-off (see [Open questions](#open-questions)).
**Owners:** Engineering (mechanism + inventory) · Compliance/Legal (regulatory
periods + GDPR) · Finance (financial-record periods) · Product (tenant tiers).

This document categorizes **every one of the 151 Prisma models**, declares the
retention behaviour that exists *today*, names who owns each undecided number,
and enumerates the cleanup machinery. It is the companion to
[`docs/encryption-data-protection.md`](encryption-data-protection.md) — that doc
covers confidentiality *at rest*; this one covers *lifecycle*.

## What this document is NOT

- **Not a regulatory commitment.** Retention periods driven by SOC 2 / ISO 27001 /
  customer contracts ride on this doc *once legal signs off*. Engineering does not
  pick those numbers in a vacuum — where a number is a legal decision, this doc
  says so and leaves it open.
- **Not a privacy notice.** The customer-facing privacy notice is a separate,
  marketing-site document. This is an internal engineering + compliance artefact.
- **Not a complete erasure plan.** GDPR Article 17 right-to-erasure is a real
  engineering effort (cascading FK deletes across tenant data while preserving
  `AuditLog` immutability is non-trivial). This doc states whether erasure is
  supported today (**it is not**, beyond `User.deletedAt` soft-delete) and what
  landing it would require — it does not implement it.

## Category breakdown (150 models)

| Category | Count | One-line posture |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| Business record | 66 | Compliance domain (Risk/Control/Policy/Audit/Vendor/…). Retained indefinitely while the tenant is active; soft-delete + 90-day purge on the 12 `SOFT_DELETE_MODELS`; `retentionUntil` sweep on 8. |
| Configuration | 40 | Tenant/org structure, templates, framework reference data, integration + security settings. Lives with the tenant; purged on tenant deletion. |
| Operational | 24 | Notifications, executions, snapshots, key-sequences, onboarding. No TTL today — prime candidates for time-boxed pruning. |
| Security ephemeral | 13 | Tokens / sessions / credentials. `expiresAt`-driven; security lifetime, **not** a data-retention conversation. |
| Regulatory artefact | 7 | `AuditLog`, `OrgAuditLog`, `ReadinessSnapshot` — immutable + hash-chained. Plus the NIS2 Article 23 incident triad (`Incident`, `IncidentNotification`, `IncidentTimelineEntry`) — incident + regulatory-notification records. Plus `AgentActionReceipt` — externally-verifiable, mediator-signed AI-agent action evidence. Retention is a **legal** decision; we do not delete by default. |
| PII subject | 2 | `User`, `AuditorAccount` — the GDPR right-to-erasure surface. **Undefined** beyond soft-delete. |
| Financial | 2 | `BillingAccount`, `BillingEvent` — typically a 7-year regulatory floor; **needs finance input**. |

## Entity inventory

`PII?` legend: `Yes` = stores personal data directly · `maybe` = may contain
user-entered free text / references · `No` = none · `ind.` = indirect (references
a `userId` but stores no contact PII).

| Entity | Category | PII? | Current retention mechanism | Policy gap |
|--------|----------|------|------------------------------|------------|

## Per-category policy

Each subsection: **Default** (what we recommend) · **Floor/ceiling** (what
regulation may force) · **Mechanism** · **Owner** · **Cleanup wiring** ·
**Customer override**.

### Business record (63)

> Risk · Control · Policy · Asset · Vendor · Audit · Task · Evidence · Finding · Process · …

- **Default:** retain indefinitely while the tenant is active. There is **no
  per-record TTL** on most of these — a `Risk` created in 2026 is still present
  in 2036 unless a user deletes it or the tenant is deleted. **This is the
  intended posture today** (compliance records are evidence of work and are
  expected to persist for the audit trail), but it should be confirmed with
  compliance rather than assumed.
- **Floor/ceiling:** none engineering-imposed. SOC 2 / ISO 27001 evidence is
  typically expected to be retained for the duration of the certification cycle
  plus a margin — a compliance decision.
- **Mechanism:** soft-delete (`deletedAt`) on 12 models in `SOFT_DELETE_MODELS`
  (`Asset, Risk, Control, Evidence, Policy, Vendor, FileRecord, Task, Finding,
  Audit, AuditCycle, AuditPack`). Soft-deleted rows on **those** models are
  hard-purged after a 90-day grace by `data-lifecycle`. 8 models carry
  `retentionUntil` (`Asset, Risk, Control, Evidence, Policy, Vendor, FileRecord,
  Task`) and are swept by `runRetentionSweep`. **Evidence is the only one with an
  end-to-end, exercised retention flow** (set date → reminder → archive → hard
  purge) and is the template for extending the rest.
- **Gap — soft-deleted rows that are never purged:** 7 models carry `deletedAt`
  but are **not** in `SOFT_DELETE_MODELS`, so their soft-deletes live forever:
  `AccessReview, AutomationRule, ControlException, LossEvent, ProcessMap,
  RiskTreatmentPlan, Tenant`. Either add them to the purge set or document why
  they are excluded.
- **Owner:** Compliance (retention period) + Engineering (mechanism).
- **Customer override:** none today. A per-tenant / per-category retention knob is
  an open question (see below).

### Regulatory artefact (3)

> `AuditLog` · `OrgAuditLog` · `ReadinessSnapshot`

- **Engineering position (firm):** `AuditLog` and `OrgAuditLog` are **immutable
  and hash-chained** (Epic C — `src/lib/audit/audit-writer.ts` + the
  `IMMUTABLE_AUDIT_LOG` DB trigger). **We do not delete audit-log entries by
  default.** Deleting them would require a coordinated schema-change PR *plus* a
  data-protection-impact-assessment, and would break the hash chain unless done
  with a documented re-chaining procedure.
- **Default / Floor / ceiling:** **deferred to legal.** The retention period under
  our SOC 2 commitments is a regulatory decision, not an engineering one.
- **Mechanism:** append-only; never soft-deleted.
- **Owner:** Legal / Compliance (period) — Engineering only executes a signed-off
  procedure.
- **Customer override:** none, and likely should remain none (tamper-evidence is
  the point).

### Operational (20)

> Notification · NotificationOutbox · ReminderHistory · `*Execution` · snapshots ·
> `*KeySequence` · TenantOnboarding · RiskSuggestion*/Simulation

- **Default:** time-boxed. These are transient/regenerable. Recommended starting
  point: **90-day hard-delete** for notifications/executions/webhook events;
  snapshots retained as long as their trend window needs (e.g. 13 months).
- **Mechanism:** **none today** — this is the largest gap. No job prunes
  `Notification`, `IntegrationExecution`, `AutomationExecution`,
  `NotificationOutbox`, etc.
- **Owner:** Engineering (these are not regulated).
- **Cleanup wiring:** to be added — see the candidate jobs in the cleanup
  inventory.
- **Customer override:** not needed (operational data is not customer-meaningful).

### Security ephemeral (13)

> PasswordResetToken · VerificationToken · TenantInvite · OrgInvite · UserSession ·
> AuthSession · Account · TenantApiKey · TenantScimToken · AuditPackShare ·
> AuditorPackAccess · UserMfaEnrollment · UserIdentityLink

- **Default:** governed by **security**, not data-retention. Lifetimes are short
  and intentional (e.g. `PasswordResetToken` 1h single-use; `UserSession` capped
  by `TenantSecuritySettings.sessionMaxAgeMinutes` + revocation, Epic C.3).
- **Mechanism:** `expiresAt` / revocation. Expired rows are inert; a periodic
  hard-delete of expired tokens is a hygiene nicety, not a compliance need.
- **Owner:** Engineering / Security.
- **Note:** a retention policy for an invite token is **not** the same
  conversation as a retention policy for a `Risk` — kept deliberately separate.

### PII subject (2)

> `User` · `AuditorAccount`

- **This is the GDPR Article 17 right-to-erasure surface.** The erasure +
  export workflow is being built as the DSAR sequence — see
  [`docs/dsar.md`](dsar.md) (Stage 1 foundation shipped; execution sequenced).
- **Supported today?** **No** — beyond `User.deletedAt` soft-delete, there is no
  erasure execution yet. Soft-deleting a `User` does not scrub their PII from the
  row, nor cascade-scrub their authored content, nor reconcile with the immutable
  `AuditLog` (which references `userId`). The DSAR foundation (`docs/dsar.md`)
  lands the model + workflow; Stage 3 lands the irreversible cascade.
- **What landing real erasure requires:** (a) a documented cascade across all
  tenant data referencing the user; (b) a decision on how to treat `AuditLog`
  references (pseudonymise the `userId`? retain under legal-basis exemption?);
  (c) an admin/self-service request flow + audit of the erasure itself; (d) a
  DPIA. Non-trivial — a dedicated follow-up effort (see Open questions).
- **Owner:** Legal (obligation + lawful-basis carve-outs) + Engineering (flow).

### Financial (2)

> `BillingAccount` · `BillingEvent`

- **Default:** retain for the regulatory financial-records period — **typically 7
  years** in most jurisdictions. **Verify with finance.**
- **Mechanism:** **none today.**
- **Owner:** Finance (period) + Engineering (mechanism).
- **Customer override:** none (regulatory floor overrides customer preference).

### Configuration (36)

> Tenant/Org structure · memberships · templates · framework reference data ·
> integration + security + notification settings

- **Default:** lives with the tenant; **purged on tenant deletion** (cascade from
  `Tenant`). No independent TTL.
- **Mechanism:** FK cascade on tenant deletion. Note `Tenant` itself soft-deletes
  (`deletedAt`) and is **not** in the purge set — a deleted tenant's data is
  retained for compliance/restore until a deliberate hard purge.
- **Owner:** Engineering + Product (tenant-deletion grace period).
- **Customer override:** n/a (this *is* the customer's configuration).

## Cleanup-job inventory

| Job (schedule) | Function | What it does | Coverage |
|----------------|----------|--------------|----------|
| `retention-sweep` (daily 04:00 UTC) | `runEvidenceRetentionSweep` (`jobs/retention.ts`) | Archives `Evidence` where `retentionUntil < now`, not already archived, not soft-deleted. Idempotent. | Evidence only |
| `daily-evidence-expiry` (daily 06:00 UTC) | `runDailyEvidenceExpiryNotifications` (`jobs/dailyEvidenceExpiry.ts`); reminder generation also in `runEvidenceRetentionNotifications` (`jobs/retention-notifications.ts`) | N-day-before (30/7/1) reminder tasks for expiring evidence, gated by `Tenant.reminderDaysBefore` (default 14). | Evidence only |
| `data-lifecycle` (daily 03:00 UTC) | `purgeSoftDeletedOlderThan` (90-day grace, 12 `SOFT_DELETE_MODELS`) · `purgeExpiredEvidenceOlderThan` (hard-delete archived evidence > 365 days) · `runRetentionSweep` (cross-model `retentionUntil` sweep over 8 `RETENTION_MODELS`) — all in `jobs/data-lifecycle.ts` | The actual purge engine: hard-deletes aged soft-deletes + aged archived evidence; sweeps `retentionUntil` across the retention models. | 12 soft-delete + 8 retention models |

`src/lib/retention-purge.ts::purgeSoftDeletedOlderThan(days)` is a manual/CLI raw-SQL
variant of the same purge (writes a hash-chained audit row), for operator-run cleanups.

### Candidate cleanup jobs the policy implies (NOT built here — follow-up PRs)

- **`operational-prune`** — hard-delete `Notification`, `NotificationOutbox`,
  `ReminderHistory`, `AutomationExecution`, `IntegrationExecution`,
  `IntegrationWebhookEvent` older than 90 days (per-table TTL).
- **`soft-delete-purge-completeness`** — extend `SOFT_DELETE_MODELS` (or a parallel
  set) to cover the 7 `deletedAt` models currently never purged.
- **`pii-erasure`** — the GDPR Article 17 flow (PII subject section).
- **`financial-retention`** — enforce the 7-year (TBD) floor on `BillingEvent` and a
  matching ceiling/expiry once finance confirms.
- **`tenant-hard-purge`** — after a tenant-deletion grace period, hard-purge a
  soft-deleted `Tenant` and its cascade.

## Open questions

Each blocks a customer/compliance sign-off. Format: **decision owner** ·
*engineering implication of each plausible answer* · **default until decided**.

1. **`AuditLog` retention under SOC 2.** Owner: **Legal/Compliance.** *Implication:*
   "retain forever" = status quo (no work); "retain N years then archive/delete" =
   a coordinated schema-change + re-chaining procedure + DPIA. **Default: retain
   indefinitely, never delete.**
2. **GDPR Article 17 right-to-erasure — supported today?** Owner: **Legal +
   Engineering.** *Implication:* it is **not** supported beyond soft-delete; landing
   it is a multi-PR effort (cascade scrub + `AuditLog` reconciliation + request
   flow + DPIA). **Default: documented follow-up effort; soft-delete only.**
3. **Evidence retention after tenant cancellation.** Owner: **Product +
   Compliance.** *Implication:* today a cancelled tenant's evidence is retained
   exactly like an active tenant's; arguably should be "retain N days, then
   hard-delete." **Default: same as active (no special cancel handling).**
4. **`BillingEvent` / `BillingAccount` retention.** Owner: **Finance.**
   *Implication:* most jurisdictions require ~7 years for financial records; pick
   the floor, then add `financial-retention`. **Default: indefinite (no job).**
5. **No-TTL business records (Risk/Control/Policy/…).** Owner: **Compliance.**
   *Implication:* "retain indefinitely while active, purge on tenant deletion" =
   status quo; "per-record TTL" = a new sweep + a per-category knob. **Default:
   indefinite while tenant active.**
6. **Operational-data TTL (Notification/execution/webhook tables).** Owner:
   **Engineering.** *Implication:* unbounded growth until addressed; a 90-day
   `operational-prune` is low-risk. **Default: no TTL (grows unbounded).**
7. **Per-category retention knobs.** Owner: **Product + Engineering.** *Implication:*
   `Tenant.reminderDaysBefore` is the *only* per-tenant retention knob today.
   Per-category knobs (`evidence_retention_days`, `audit_log_retention_years`,
   `notification_retention_days`) would be a tier-gated feature. **Default: single
   global behaviour, no per-tenant retention configuration.**
8. **The 7 `deletedAt`-but-never-purged models.** Owner: **Engineering.**
   *Implication:* `AccessReview, AutomationRule, ControlException, LossEvent,
   ProcessMap, RiskTreatmentPlan, Tenant` accumulate soft-deleted rows forever;
   either add to the purge set or document the exclusion. **Default: never purged.**
