# Contributing to Inflect Compliance

This is the **developer onboarding guide** — the bridge between
[`README.md`](README.md) (boot the app) and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (the full
architecture spec). The goal is concrete: **land your first PR within a day.**

It is *not* an architecture spec (that's `CLAUDE.md`), a Next.js/React/TypeScript
tutorial (vendor docs), or a style guide (ESLint + Prettier + structural ratchets
enforce style — this doc names them, it doesn't re-litigate them).

---

## Before you start

**What this product is.** Inflect is a multi-tenant Governance, Risk & Compliance
(GRC) SaaS: organizations manage controls, risks, assets, evidence, policies, and
audits across frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIS2, …), with cross-framework
mapping. The user-facing surface is a Next.js web app; everything is scoped to a
tenant. When you change a feature, you're affecting what a compliance team sees
and the audit trail they rely on.

**Required knowledge.** Next.js App Router, React 19, TypeScript. You do **not**
need to know the compliance domain up front — learn it as you touch it.

**Required tooling.**

| Tool | Version | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| Node | **24** (pinned in `.nvmrc`; `engines` requires `>=24 <25`) | runtime + build |
| npm | **10+** | package manager (lockfile is authoritative — use `npm ci`) |
| Docker Compose | any recent | local PostgreSQL + Redis |
| `psql` | optional | ad-hoc DB inspection |

`nvm use` reads `.nvmrc` and gives you the right Node. The app will not start on
Node < 24.

---

## Local dev loop

Bring up the infra, install, seed, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d        # PostgreSQL + Redis (required — see Gotchas)
nvm use                     # Node 24
npm ci                      # deterministic install from the lockfile
npm run db:reset            # migrate + seed (DESTRUCTIVE — wipes local data)
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:3000
```

**The five commands that are 95% of daily work:**

| Command | When |
|---------|------|
| `npm run dev` | run the app locally |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` — run before every commit |
| `npm test` | Jest (single file: `npx jest path/to/file.test.ts`) |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (`npm run lint -- --fix` for auto-fixable) |
| `npm run db:reset` | re-migrate + re-seed after a schema change |

The other 35+ scripts live in [`package.json`](package.json) — reach for them
on demand, not on day one.

**Demo users** (provisioned by `prisma/seed.ts`, local dev only — the password is
set in the seed script and is intentionally not published):

| Email | Role |
|-------|------|
| admin@acme.com | Owner |
| editor@acme.com | Editor |
| viewer@acme.com | Viewer |

## How the codebase is organized

A 50-line tour. The canonical deep dive is `CLAUDE.md` → **Architecture**; read
this to orient, read that to understand.

```
src/app/api/          HTTP boundary ONLY. Route handlers parse input (Zod),
                      call a usecase, return a response. No business logic here.
                      params are typed Promise<…> (Next 15+); wrap with
                      withApiErrorHandling + requirePermission(<key>) on
                      privileged routes.

src/app-layer/        The business core:
  usecases/           orchestration — validate → policy check → repo → emit event
  policies/           authorization (assertCanRead/Write/Admin) — before data access
  repositories/       ALL Prisma queries — EVERY query filters by tenantId
  jobs/               BullMQ background jobs (executor-registry.ts dispatches)
  services/           cross-cutting domain services
  events/             hash-chained audit-trail writers
  schemas/            Zod input schemas (backend)

src/lib/              shared infra — auth, observability, security, billing,
                      rate-limiting, db (RLS middleware), errors

src/components/       React (UI primitives in src/components/ui/* — use them,
                      never hand-roll a table/modal/button)

prisma/schema/        MULTI-FILE schema (base/auth/compliance/vendor/audit/
                      automation/…). See prisma/schema/README.md. After editing:
                      npm run db:generate.

tests/                unit/ integration/ e2e/ guards/ guardrails/ contracts/
                      rendered/  — see "CI signals" + "Common gotchas"
```

Every usecase and repository receives a `RequestContext` (`userId`, `tenantId`,
`role`, permissions) via AsyncLocalStorage — never thread it manually; access via
`getRequestContext()`. See `CLAUDE.md` → **Request Context**.

---

## Your first PR — a working example

**Task: add a `framework` filter to the Controls list API.** This is a real
vertical slice that touches every layer once. Edit the files **in this order**:

1. **Repository** — `src/app-layer/repositories/ControlRepository.ts`
   Add `framework?: string` to the `ControlListFilters` interface, and apply it
   in the `list(db, ctx, params)` where-clause. Note the method shape every repo
   follows: `static async list(db: PrismaTx, ctx: RequestContext, …)` and the
   where-clause **always** includes `tenantId: ctx.tenantId`. Keep it.

2. **Usecase** — `src/app-layer/usecases/control/queries.ts`
   Thread the new filter from the usecase input into the repo call. The usecase
   calls the policy (`assertCanReadControls(ctx)`) before touching data — leave
   that in place.

3. **Input schema** — the controls route parses its query params with a Zod
   schema. Add `framework: z.string().optional()` to it (define it inline in the
   route, or in `src/app-layer/schemas/` if it's shared).

4. **API route** — `src/app/api/t/[tenantSlug]/controls/route.ts`
   Parse the new query param and pass it into the usecase. The route stays thin:
   parse → usecase → respond.

5. **Test** — extend `tests/unit/control-queries-usecase.test.ts`
   Add a case: given controls across two frameworks, filtering by one returns
   only those. Use `buildRequestContext()` from `tests/helpers/make-context.ts`.

6. **(If applicable) ratchet** — if you added a column to the schema or a new
   `findMany`, a structural guard may fire (see "CI signals"). Read the failure;
   it tells you exactly what to update.

**CI signals you should see go green:** `Typecheck`, `Lint`, `Test (shard N/4)`,
`Build`. Open the PR as a draft first if you want CI feedback before review.

You should be able to follow this and have a real PR open in ~2 hours.

---

## CI signals + how to debug them

The five red flags you'll hit most, in priority order:

1. **`Typecheck` red** → run `npx tsc --noEmit` locally. The error names the file
   + line. Fix the type; do **not** reach for `as any` (see "Contracts").

2. **`Lint` red** → `npm run lint`; try `npm run lint -- --fix` for the
   auto-fixable subset. Remaining issues are real — fix them.

3. **A `tests/guards/*.test.ts` or `tests/guardrails/*.test.ts` failure** → this
   is a **structural ratchet**, not a flaky test. **Read the failure message** —
   it tells you whether you removed something (lower the count/baseline in the
   same PR) or added a regression (revert the thing that tripped it). Never
   "make it green" by gaming the number; the message says which way is correct.

4. **`tests/contracts/api-schemas.test.ts` (or `route-contracts`) red** → you
   changed a Zod schema that's part of the published OpenAPI contract. Run
   `npm run openapi:generate`, then `npx jest tests/contracts -u` to refresh the
   snapshots, and review the diff in your PR.

5. **An `E2E` shard failure** → open the Playwright **HTML report artifact** on
   the failed run; the test name points at the spec file. E2E is serial and
   isolation-sensitive — re-read "Common gotchas" before assuming it's flaky.

**Ask for help** when: a guard failure's message doesn't make sense after you've
read it, or an E2E failure reproduces locally and isn't isolation-related. **Push
through** when: typecheck/lint/contract failures (the fix command is above and
deterministic).

---

## The contracts you cannot break

Internalize these before touching the relevant area. They're enforced — but the
failure is cheaper to avoid than to debug.

- **Audit-log immutability (Epic C).** NEVER `UPDATE` or `DELETE` an `AuditLog` /
  `OrgAuditLog` row. The `IMMUTABLE_AUDIT_LOG` DB trigger refuses it and your code
  explodes at runtime. Write entries only via the hash-chained writer
  (`src/lib/audit/audit-writer.ts` / `logEvent`).

- **`tenantId` on every repository query (Epic A.1 RLS + app-layer defence).**
  PostgreSQL Row-Level Security is the backstop, but a query that forgets
  `tenantId` fails *opaquely* ("0 rows returned", not "permission denied") — and a
  fresh repository method missing the filter is a reviewable defect. Always filter
  by `ctx.tenantId`.

- **Field-encryption manifest (Epic B).** NEVER persist plaintext into an
  encrypted column. The Prisma middleware encrypts on write **only** for fields in
  `src/lib/security/encrypted-fields.ts` — it will not save you if a typed-`any`
  payload side-steps the manifest. Add a model's field there, or it ships in
  cleartext.

- **The `as any` ratchet.** `tests/guardrails/no-explicit-any-ratchet.test.ts`
  caps the `src/` count (currently **0**) and is CI-blocking. Do NOT add a cast to
  paper over a typing problem — fix the type. See `CLAUDE.md` →
  **Codebase-hygiene ratchets**.

## Read these next

Eight reads for your first two weeks, in order. Everything *not* on this list is
on-demand — read it when you touch that surface.

1. [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — the **Architecture** + **Request Context** sections
   (skim, ~15 min). The mental model for every change.
2. [`docs/coverage-policy.md`](docs/coverage-policy.md) — the testing contract:
   what coverage floor your layer carries and why.
3. [`docs/dependency-policy.md`](docs/dependency-policy.md) — read before you add
   a single dependency.
4. [`docs/auth.md`](docs/auth.md) — the auth flow + JWT shape (NextAuth v4).
5. [`docs/billing.md`](docs/billing.md) — SaaS vs. self-hosted modes + entitlements.
6. [`docs/observability/01-deployment-topology.md`](docs/observability/01-deployment-topology.md)
   — where signals flow and how the stack is deployed.
7. [`docs/incident-response.md`](docs/incident-response.md) — skim now; you'll need
   it when you're on call.
8. [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — the **Codebase-hygiene ratchets** + **Failing tests**
   sections. How the ratchets think, and the "a failing test is a failing test"
   rule.

## When something goes wrong — escalation paths

- **Stuck on a CI failure** → open a **draft PR** and ask the team in the PR
  thread; paste the failing job's error.
- **Suspected security issue** → [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) (private GitHub
  Security Advisory — do not open a public issue).
- **Unsure whether to add a dependency** →
  [`docs/dependency-risk-review.md`](docs/dependency-risk-review.md).
- **Production runtime issue** → [`docs/incident-response.md`](docs/incident-response.md).
- **Shipping a migration / infra / secret-rotation change** → it's a SIGNIFICANT
  change: include a rollback plan + a second engineer's `Sign-off:`. See
  [`docs/change-management-policy.md`](docs/change-management-policy.md).
- **A structural ratchet you don't understand** → read its docstring (top of the
  test file) — they're written to explain themselves — then ask in the PR.

## Common gotchas

The paper cuts that bite new contributors:

1. **The Prisma schema is FOLDER-based, not one file.** Edit
   `prisma/schema/<domain>.prisma`, then run `npm run db:generate`. The generator
   + datasource live ONLY in `base.prisma` — don't duplicate them.
2. **`npm run dev` needs Postgres + Redis.** Run `docker-compose up -d` first, or
   it crashes on the first DB/Redis call.
3. **`npm run db:reset` is DESTRUCTIVE.** It drops, re-migrates, and re-seeds —
   you lose local data. That's the point; just know it.
4. **`next dev` compiles routes lazily.** POST to a brand-new route and get a
   one-off 500? Retry — the route JIT-compiled on first hit. (This does NOT happen
   in the production build.)
5. **Jest runs in shards.** A single file works with `npx jest <file>`. To run the
   whole suite the way CI does, use `npm run test:ci` (sequential, no coverage).
6. **E2E spec isolation is structural.** Read the docstring in
   `tests/e2e/fixtures.ts` BEFORE writing a mutating spec — mutating specs use the
   `isolatedTenant`/`authedPage` fixtures; read-only specs share the seeded tenant.
   A cross-test `let` cascade is banned and guard-enforced.
7. **Never `console.log` in server code.** Use the observability `logger` —
   a guard fails CI on `console.*` in `src/`.
8. **Use the UI primitives.** `<DataTable>`, `<Modal>`, `<FilterToolbar>`,
   `<Button>`, etc. live in `src/components/ui/*`. Hand-rolling a `<table>` or a
   `fixed inset-0` overlay trips an Epic-5x ratchet.
9. **`SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1`** is set in tests so the env loader doesn't crash;
   never add raw `process.env` access in source — add the var to `src/env.ts`
   first.
10. **Two `DATABASE_URL`s.** `DATABASE_URL` → PgBouncer (runtime); 
    `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` → direct Postgres (migrations). Don't swap them.

Welcome aboard. When in doubt, open a draft PR early and let CI + a reviewer guide
you — that's the fastest path to a merged first change.
