## Architecture

### Framework baseline

**Next.js 16.2.6** (App Router) + **React 19.2** + **TypeScript 5.5**.
The React 18 → 19 bump (#67) is complete: React 19 removed
`propTypes`, function-component `defaultProps`, string refs and
legacy context — the codebase carries none of those.
`forwardRef` still works in React 19 (which also accepts `ref` as a
plain prop); existing `forwardRef` call sites are fine and
modernising them is optional.
GAP-05 (2026-04-25) first migrated off the vulnerable `next@^14.2.0` line —
the two HIGH advisories (Image Optimizer DoS, RSC request
deserialization) were unfixable in 14.x. CI security gates restored
to their pre-workaround strictness, and on 2026-05-12 tightened one
further notch: npm audit blocks on **MODERATE+** (production deps),
Trivy blocks on `CRITICAL,HIGH` (container scan). The structural
ratchet at `tests/guardrails/security-gate-strictness.test.ts` fails
CI if either gate is silently re-lowered (`moderate` → `high` /
`critical`, or `CRITICAL,HIGH` → `CRITICAL`) or `next` is downgraded
back to 14.x.

Async-request-API caveat: wrapped route handlers still type
`params` synchronously; the transparent-await shim in
`src/lib/errors/api.ts::withApiErrorHandling` resolves the Promise
before forwarding ctx to the inner handler so existing call sites stay
correct. The codebase now runs on Next 16 — migrating every site to
explicit `await params` (retiring the shim) is the remaining
outstanding follow-up. See
`docs/implementation-notes/2026-04-25-gap-05-next15-migration.md`.

### Layer Structure

```
src/app/api/           → Next.js route handlers (HTTP boundary only — parse input, call usecases, return responses)
src/app-layer/usecases/→ Business logic orchestration (thin: validate → call policy → call repo → emit event)
src/app-layer/policies/→ Authorization checks (assertCanRead/Write/Admin/Audit) — always called before data access
src/app-layer/repositories/ → All Prisma queries (every query must filter by tenantId)
src/app-layer/jobs/    → BullMQ job definitions (background tasks)
src/app-layer/services/→ Cross-cutting domain services (library import, cross-framework traceability)
src/app-layer/events/  → Audit event writers (immutable, hash-chained audit trail)
src/lib/               → Shared infrastructure (auth, observability, storage, rate-limiting, permissions)
src/components/        → React components

prisma/schema/         → Multi-file Prisma schema (GAP-09):
                            base.prisma         — generator + datasource (sole owners)
                            enums.prisma        — every shared enum
                            auth.prisma         — Tenant/User/Membership/Session/SSO/Billing
                            compliance.prisma   — Control/Risk/Evidence/Framework/Policy/Asset/etc.
                            vendor.prisma       — Vendor + assessment graph
                            audit.prisma        — AuditCycle/Pack/Auditor + AuditLog
                            automation.prisma   — AutomationRule/Execution + Notification + Integration
                            schema.prisma       — transitional sediment file (currently empty)
                          See prisma/schema/README.md for the full layout + conventions.
                          Adding a new model: pick the matching domain file. Generator
                          and datasource ONLY live in base.prisma — Prisma rejects
                          duplicates across the folder.
```

### Request Context (`RequestContext`)

Every usecase and repository receives a `RequestContext` (defined in `src/app-layer/types.ts`) containing `userId`, `tenantId`, `role`, `permissions`, and `appPermissions`. This is propagated via AsyncLocalStorage — never thread through manually. Access via `getRequestContext()` from `src/lib/observability`.

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

Two layers, both load-bearing:

1. **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security** (Epic A.1). Every tenant-scoped
   table has `tenant_isolation` + `superuser_bypass` policies and
   `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Tenant context is bound per-transaction
   via `runInTenantContext` from `@/lib/db/rls-middleware`. The DB
   returns zero rows if the context is unset on an `app_user`
   session — isolation is architecturally impossible to bypass by
   accident. **See `docs/rls-tenant-isolation.md`** for the full guide
   including the bypass model, the policy shapes for nullable /
   ownership-chained tables, and how to add a new tenant-scoped model.

2. **Application-layer `tenantId` filters** — every repository query
   also filters by `tenantId`. Defence in depth; makes error messages
   clear when the app is working correctly.

Guard tests: `tests/guardrails/rls-coverage.test.ts` (DB-backed — CI
fails if a tenant table is missing RLS) and
`tests/unit/tenant-isolation-structural.test.ts` (code-pattern scanner).

### API Rate Limiting (Epic A.2 + GAP-17)

Three tiers, each scoped to a different traffic class. Full operator
runbook in `docs/rate-limiting.md`.

**Mutation tier** (Epic A.2). Every route wrapped with
`withApiErrorHandling` gets `API_MUTATION_LIMIT` (60/min) on
POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH by default. Stricter presets (`LOGIN_LIMIT`,
`API_KEY_CREATE_LIMIT`, `EMAIL_DISPATCH_LIMIT`) are applied via
`{ rateLimit: { config, scope } }` options on specific routes. Keyed
`(IP, userId)`. Storage: in-process Map (Node runtime).

**Read tier** (GAP-17). Tenant-scoped GETs on `/api/t/<slug>/...` go
through `API_READ_LIMIT` (120/min) at the Edge middleware via
`src/lib/rate-limit/apiReadRateLimit.ts`. Keyed `(IP, userId,
tenantSlug)` for per-tenant + per-user isolation. Health probes
(`/api/health`, `/api/livez`, `/api/readyz`) and `/api/docs` are
explicitly excluded — operators must keep monitoring access during
attacks. Storage: Upstash + memory fallback (mirrors `authRateLimit.ts`).
The wire-up sits AFTER the JWT verify + tenant-access gate so
unauthorized requests get the cheaper 401/403 first; structural
ratchet at `tests/guardrails/api-read-rate-limit.test.ts` enforces
the ordering + exclusion list.

**Auth tier** (covered separately by `src/lib/rate-limit/authRateLimit.ts`).
Tiered per-endpoint policy at the Edge: 10/min for sign-in callbacks,
30/min for session probes, 60/min for csrf/providers. Keyed `(IP,
ua-hash)` because it runs pre-authentication.

429 responses carry `Retry-After` + `X-RateLimit-*` + `x-request-id`.
Body never contains IP/userId/tenantSlug. Bypass via
`RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=0` env or inside tests (automatic). All presets
live in `src/lib/security/rate-limit.ts`; the Node wrapper is
`src/lib/security/rate-limit-middleware.ts`; the edge enforcement
modules live under `src/lib/rate-limit/`.

### Auth Brute-Force Protection (Epic A.3)

`authenticateWithPassword` applies `LOGIN_PROGRESSIVE_POLICY`:
3 failures → 5s delay, 5 → 30s, 10 → 15-min lockout. Timing is
equalised via `dummyVerify` so lockout is indistinguishable from
wrong-password. Signup rejects known-breached passwords via
`checkPasswordAgainstHIBP` (k-anonymity, fail-open on HIBP outage).
Password change / reset routes do not exist yet; when they land,
wire HIBP the same way.

**See `docs/epic-a-security.md`** for the unified operator runbook
(verification commands, rollback procedure, observability signals)
and `docs/rls-tenant-isolation.md` for the RLS deep dive.

### Field Encryption (Epic B)

Business-content fields (Finding.description, Risk.treatmentNotes,
PolicyVersion.contentText, TaskComment.body, …) are encrypted at
rest by a Prisma `$use` middleware. The manifest lives in
`src/lib/security/encrypted-fields.ts`; **never** add or remove
encrypted columns outside it. Add a model here ⇒ its manifest
fields encrypt on every write and decrypt on every read
transparently.

Key hierarchy: `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (master KEK) wraps a per-tenant
DEK on `Tenant.encryptedDek`. New tenants get a DEK at creation via
`createTenantWithDek` (from `src/lib/security/tenant-key-manager.ts`);
existing tenants get one via `scripts/generate-tenant-deks.ts`.
Ciphertexts carry `v1:` (global KEK, legacy) or `v2:` (per-tenant
DEK) envelope — the middleware dispatches per-value on read.

**GAP-03 — production fail-fast.** The master KEK is REQUIRED in
production. Three independent checks each refuse to start a prod
process whose `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is missing, shorter than 32
chars, or equal to the documented dev fallback:

  1. zod schema in `src/env.ts` — fires at module load, `superRefine`
     on the field reads `process.env.NODE_ENV` directly.
  2. startup hook in `src/instrumentation.ts` (web) +
     `scripts/worker.ts` (BullMQ worker) + `scripts/scheduler.ts`
     (deploy-time scheduler) — exits 1 with `[startup] FATAL: …`.
     The web tier additionally runs an encrypt → decrypt sentinel
     to catch keys that pass structural checks but break HKDF/AES.
  3. Compose `:?error` syntax in `docker-compose.prod.yml` /
     `docker-compose.staging.yml` / `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`
     — aborts container start before the app process is spawned.

Dev gets the in-source fallback key (`encryption-constants.ts`) with
a WARN log on every server start; test gets the same fallback
silently. The fallback is well-known + refused in prod, not secret.
The runtime + structural enforcement is unit-tested in
`tests/unit/security/startup-encryption-check.test.ts` +
`tests/unit/env.test.ts`, and the wiring across all five surfaces
is locked by `tests/guardrails/encryption-key-enforcement.test.ts`.

Master-KEK rotation: set `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` alongside
the new primary. `decryptField` falls back transparently. Admins
trigger the v1→v2 re-encryption sweep via
`POST /api/t/{slug}/admin/key-rotation`, which enqueues the
background job in `src/app-layer/jobs/key-rotation.ts`. The job
re-encrypts every `v1:` ciphertext under the new primary KEK and
re-wraps the per-tenant DEK. When every tenant reports zero `v1:`
rows under the old key, remove `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` from
env.

Per-tenant DEK rotation (generating a fresh DEK for a single
compromised tenant without touching the global KEK) is implemented
at `rotateTenantDek` in `src/lib/security/tenant-key-manager.ts`.
The admin surface is `POST /api/t/:slug/admin/tenant-dek-rotation`,
gated by `admin.tenant_lifecycle` (OWNER-only). The flow:
atomic UPDATE moves the old wrapped DEK into
`Tenant.previousEncryptedDek` and writes a fresh wrapped DEK to
`Tenant.encryptedDek`; the response is 202 + a job id for the
`tenant-dek-rotation` BullMQ sweep that re-encrypts every v2
ciphertext under the new DEK and clears `previousEncryptedDek` on
completion. Mid-flight reads remain correct via
`decryptWithKeyOrPrevious` in the encryption layer — primary first,
fall back to previous on AES-GCM auth failure. The per-tenant DEK
fallback is locked in by
`tests/guardrails/tenant-dek-rotation-fallback.test.ts`.

**See `docs/epic-b-encryption.md`** for deployment order,
rotation runbook, observability signals, rollback procedure, and
the full test coverage map.

### Defense-in-Depth (Epic C)

Five complementary controls. Treat them as one system — each
sub-epic has the others as backstops.

**C.1 — API permission middleware.** Wrap every privileged API
handler with `requirePermission(<key>, …)` from
`@/lib/security/permission-middleware`. The key is a typed dotted
literal (`'admin.scim'`, `'risks.create'`, …) derived from
`PermissionSet`. Denials emit a hash-chained `AUTHZ_DENIED` audit
entry (`category: 'access'`) and surface as a generic 403 — the
key itself is never echoed to the client. The route ↔ map sync is
guarded by `tests/guardrails/api-permission-coverage.test.ts`;
new admin/privileged routes MUST add a rule in
`src/lib/security/route-permissions.ts` and use
`requirePermission(...)`. Avoid the legacy
`requireAdminCtx` helper for new code — it still works but the
permission-key model is the canonical pattern.

**C.2 — Secret detection.** Local pre-commit hook
(`.husky/pre-commit` → `scripts/detect-secrets.sh`) scans staged
files; CI guardrail (`tests/guardrails/no-secrets.test.ts`) walks
the whole tree. Both load patterns from `.secret-patterns` (one
source of truth). Carve-outs: inline
`// pragma: allowlist secret` for one-off lines, or move fixtures
under `tests/fixtures/secrets/` (auto-skipped). Pre-existing
placeholder fixtures live in `REPO_BASELINE` in the guardrail; add
to that array only with a written `reason`.

**C.3 — Session hardening.** A `UserSession` row is minted on every
sign-in (NextAuth `jwt` callback → `recordNewSession`) carrying
`ipAddress`, `userAgent`, `expiresAt`, `lastActiveAt`. Every JWT
pass calls `verifyAndTouchSession` — revoked or expired rows
short-circuit as `SessionRevoked`. Per-tenant policy lives on
`TenantSecuritySettings.maxConcurrentSessions` (overflow → revoke
oldest by `lastActiveAt` ASC) and `sessionMaxAgeMinutes` (caps
`expiresAt` at insert time). The admin UI lives at
`/admin/members` — Sessions column + modal + per-row revoke,
backed by `GET/DELETE /api/t/:slug/admin/sessions`. The pre-Epic-C
endpoints (`security/sessions/revoke-current` etc.) and the
`User.sessionVersion` bump still work as the coarse-grained
backstop.

**C.4 — Audit event streaming.** Every committed audit row is
fired through `streamAuditEvent` into a per-tenant in-memory
buffer (lazy-imported by `appendAuditEntry` so cold-start cost is
zero for tenants without streaming configured). Flush happens on
100 events OR 5 seconds, HMAC-SHA256-signed
(`X-Inflect-Signature: sha256=<hex>`), POSTed to
`TenantSecuritySettings.auditStreamUrl`. The HMAC secret is on
the same row (`auditStreamSecretEncrypted`), encrypted at rest via
the Epic B field-encryption manifest. Fail-safe — the audit row is
already committed, so a broken SIEM never undoes the write.
Privacy-aware payload — free-text `details` is dropped, only
structured `detailsJson` ships; actor is opaque `userId` +
`actorType`, never email. Each batch delivery gets up to 3 attempts
(original + 2 retries) with linear backoff (1 s, 2 s). Kill-switch
via `AUDIT_STREAM_RETRY_ENABLED=0`.

**C.5 — Server-side rich-text sanitisation.** Use
`sanitizeRichTextHtml` / `sanitizePlainText` /
`sanitizePolicyContent` from `@/lib/security/sanitize` BEFORE
persisting any user-supplied rich-text. Already wired into
`policy.createPolicy`, `policy.createPolicyVersion`,
`task.addTaskComment`, `issue.addIssueComment`. New write paths
that accept HTML or comment text MUST sanitise at the usecase
layer (not just at render time) — render-time sanitisation alone
would leave the row dangerous to PDF export, audit-pack share
links, and future SDK consumers reading the row verbatim. The
allowlist (tags, attributes, link schemes) is in
`src/lib/security/sanitize.ts`; do not widen it without a security
review.

**See `docs/epic-c-security.md`** for the unified operator
runbook (env vars, verification commands, rollback procedures,
failure modes) and `SECURITY.md` for the responsible-disclosure
policy.

### Isolation & Sanitisation Completeness (Epic D)

Epic D closed three concrete gaps left after Epic C. Each is now
guarded by a CI ratchet so the regression surface is small.

**D.1 — `UserSession` RLS.** The Epic C.3 `UserSession` table
shipped without RLS policies. It now carries a single asymmetric
`tenant_isolation` policy (`USING (tenantId IS NULL OR own) WITH
CHECK (own)`) plus the canonical `superuser_bypass`, with `FORCE
ROW LEVEL SECURITY` enabled. The single-policy form is mandatory
because `tenantId` is nullable: a split `tenant_isolation_insert`
policy would be a permissive sibling that lets `app_user` UPDATE a
NULL row to any tenantId. `UserSession` is listed in
`SINGLE_POLICY_EXCEPTIONS` in `tests/guardrails/rls-coverage.test.ts`,
where the post-loop sanity check verifies the asymmetric `qual` +
`with_check` shape is real — a future "simplify" PR that strips
either clause fails CI. See migration
`prisma/migrations/20260423150000_epic_d1_user_session_rls/` and
`tests/integration/user-session-rls.test.ts` for the seven
behavioural assertions (own-INSERT accepts; foreign-INSERT rejects;
NULL-INSERT-under-app_user rejects; NULL-row-claim-to-other-tenant
rejects; etc.).

**D.2 — Encrypted-field write paths sanitised.** Five usecase
files (`finding`, `risk`, `vendor`, `audit`, `control-test`) wrote
to encrypted free-text columns without server-side sanitisation.
Encryption protects confidentiality at rest; sanitisation protects
every downstream renderer (UI, PDF export, audit-pack share link,
SDK consumer reading the row verbatim) that decrypts and reads the
field. All five now route user-supplied free text through
`sanitizePlainText` (or, for surfaces that share the call shape,
the per-file `sanitizeOptional` helper that preserves the
undefined/null/string three-state contract). The
`tests/guardrails/sanitize-rich-text-coverage.test.ts` ratchet has
`SANITISER_COVERAGE_FLOOR = 8`; a future PR cannot silently drop
one of the eight known sanitised usecases without bumping the
floor in the same diff. The companion
`tests/unit/security/sanitize-write-paths.test.ts` carries 20
write-path assertions — one positive XSS-strip per call site.

**D.3 — Legacy `requireAdminCtx` migrated to `requirePermission`.**
Seven tenant API routes (billing × 3, security/sessions × 2,
security/mfa/policy PUT, sso) used the legacy role-tier guard,
which threw a 403 but **did not write an `AUTHZ_DENIED` audit
row** and was invisible to the Epic C.1 permission guardrail. All
seven now use `requirePermission(...)` — denials audit cleanly,
and `tests/guardrails/api-permission-coverage.test.ts` now treats
`billing/`, `sso/`, and `security/` as privileged roots with five
self-service routes (own MFA enrolment, own session revocation)
explicitly listed in `EXCLUDED_ROUTES` with written reasons. The
canonical pattern for new admin routes is
`requirePermission('<key>', handler)` — now the *only*
admin-authorization guard: the legacy `requireAdminCtx` /
`requireWriteCtx` / `requireRoleCtx` helpers were removed
(2026-05-21) once every route had migrated, and the ratchet
`tests/guardrails/no-legacy-admin-guard.test.ts` keeps them from
returning.

**See `docs/epic-d-completeness.md`** for the Epic D operator
runbook (verification commands, rollback procedures, the five
self-service security carve-outs, the asymmetric-RLS rationale).

### Observability & Operational Hardening (Epic E)

Three remediations that close the operational gaps left after Epic D.
Treat them as one subsystem — each protects a different blast-radius
class for the same deploy event.

**E.2 — Audit-stream retry + idempotency key.** `deliverBatch` in
`src/app-layer/events/audit-stream.ts` now attempts each batch up
to 3 times (original + 2 retries) on `408 / 429 / 5xx / network
throw`. Linear backoff (1 s, 2 s). Every attempt carries the SAME
`X-Inflect-Batch-Id` header — deterministic from
`(tenantId, schemaVersion, eventIds)` via `computeBatchId` in
`src/app-layer/events/webhook-headers.ts`. The same id doubles as
`X-Inflect-Idempotency-Key`, so consumer SIEMs dedupe retries with
zero retry-aware code on our side. Kill-switch via
`AUDIT_STREAM_RETRY_ENABLED=0` (force single-POST for debugging a
misbehaving SIEM without redeploy). A module-level
`_deliveryFailureCount` counter bumps once per batch whose final
attempt is still not-ok — future work wires this to OTel.

`webhook-headers.ts` is the canonical module for any future outbound
webhook in the repo (SCIM push, billing fanout, per-tenant SIEM
pluralisation). Every caller uses `buildOutboundHeaders(...)` and
`computeBatchId(...)` — never spell `X-Inflect-*` header names
inline, never hand-roll dedupe keys.

**E.3 — Graceful shutdown.** On a rolling deploy the process receives
SIGTERM. Without a drain handler, three observability surfaces lose
data: per-tenant audit-stream buffers (irreversible — events never
reach the SIEM), OTel span batches still in the `BatchSpanProcessor`,
and Sentry errors still in the transport queue.
`installShutdownHandlers()` in `src/lib/observability/shutdown.ts`
drains all three in the order most-to-least critical for audit
correctness: audit buffers first, then OTel, then Sentry. Each stage
is `Promise.race`'d against its per-stage budget from
`src/lib/observability/shutdown-budget.ts` so a slow exporter never
blocks past the container's grace period (k8s default 30 s). The
three stage budgets (3 s + 2 s + 2 s = 7 s) fit under the 20 s
ceiling — leaving 10+ s for Next.js's own HTTP-drain handler
running in parallel. The handler never calls `process.exit` —
`next start` owns the process lifecycle. Registration happens in
`src/instrumentation.ts::register()`, after all `init*` calls, and
is idempotent under HMR via a module-level flag. SIGINT gets the
same treatment. A second SIGTERM falls through to Node's default
(via `process.once`) so an escalating runtime can always terminate.

Paired shutdown helpers live beside their init counterparts:
`shutdownTelemetry` in `src/lib/observability/instrumentation.ts`,
`shutdownSentry` in `src/lib/observability/sentry.ts`. Both are
bounded, idempotent, never throw — the handler composes them as
stable contracts.

**E.4 — HIBP guardrail.** `tests/guardrails/hibp-coverage.test.ts`
locks in the invariant that every API route ingesting a
user-chosen password MUST import AND call
`checkPasswordAgainstHIBP`. Mirrors the
`sanitize-rich-text-coverage.test.ts` template: a curated
`HIBP_REQUIRED_ROUTES` list (today: just `auth/register`) paired
with a structural scan of `src/app/api/**/route.ts` for
password-shaped Zod fields. An in-memory mutation regression proof
confirms the detector catches removals. Vacuously passes today —
the first password-change / reset / recovery route forced to
register is the point.

**See `docs/epic-e-observability.md`** for the Epic E operator
runbook (verification commands, rollback procedures, how to add a
new password-handling route, how to add a new outbound webhook).

### Finishing Touches (Epic F)

Small, independent remediations that close the long tail after
Epic E. Each landed as a focused PR; treating them as one "epic"
was purely a scheduling convenience.

**F.2 — `rotateTenantDek` reserved (since superseded).** Originally
landed as a stub at
`src/lib/security/tenant-key-manager.ts::rotateTenantDek(tenantId)`
that threw a runbook-carrying error pointing at the master-KEK
rotation workaround. The reservation included a new
`Tenant.previousEncryptedDek String?` column from migration
`20260424010000_add_tenant_previous_encrypted_dek`, paired with a
CHECK constraint (`previousEncryptedDek IS NULL OR !=
encryptedDek` — silent key-mixing guard) and a partial index for
the eventual sweep-rotations query.

The real implementation has since landed (see the "Field
Encryption" section above). The reservation paid off: the
implementation slotted in without a schema change and without any
caller-signature break (the function now takes an options object
instead of a single id; the only previous caller was the stub
test itself). Integration test renamed to
`tests/integration/tenant-dek-rotation.test.ts` — happy-path swap
+ double-rotation rejection + the original CHECK-constraint
assertion preserved verbatim.

**F.3 — `HttpMethod` union + sentinel comment.** The route
permission matcher previously did
`rule.methods.map((m) => m.toUpperCase()).includes(upperMethod)`
per gated-route request. The new `type HttpMethod = 'GET' | 'POST'
| 'PUT' | 'PATCH' | 'DELETE'` union enforces uppercase at compile
time, so the hot path drops the `.map(...)` allocation.
Ratchet: `tests/guardrails/route-permissions-uppercase.test.ts`
catches `as` casts, lowercase union-member additions, and type
widening back to `readonly string[]`. Separately, `encryption.ts:139`
now carries a three-state sentinel comment explaining that
`_lastPreviousKeySource: string | null | undefined` uses all three
states deliberately (undefined = never checked, null = checked-no-key,
string = checked-with-key-source).

**F.4 — SECURITY.md + detect-secrets.** `SECURITY.md` now documents
GitHub Security Advisories as the private-by-default primary
reporting channel (no fabricated security email). `scripts/detect-secrets.sh`
uses `git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR` so renamed
files with staged secrets still get scanned.

**See `docs/epic-f-finishing-touches.md`** for the Epic F operator
runbook (verification commands, rollback procedures, how to add a
new DEK-lifecycle verb to `tenant-key-manager`).

### Access Control & Tenant Onboarding (Epic 1)

Closes the audit's GAP-01 (Critical): OAuth sign-in no longer
silently grants ADMIN on the oldest tenant. Authentication and
tenant membership are now orthogonal — sign-in alone authenticates
the user; tenant access requires an explicit grant via one of the
allowlisted paths.

**Role model.** The `Role` enum now has five values:
`OWNER | ADMIN | EDITOR | READER | AUDITOR`. OWNER is strictly
superior to ADMIN — it gains `admin.tenant_lifecycle` (delete
tenant, rotate DEK, transfer ownership) and `admin.owner_management`
(invite/remove OWNERs, assign OWNER role). ADMIN has every other
admin flag but explicitly denies those two. The `PermissionSet`
resolution in `src/lib/permissions.ts` enforces the distinction at
compile time; `getPermissionsForRole('ADMIN').admin.tenant_lifecycle`
is `false` by type.

**Membership creation is explicit.** Only three paths can write a
`TenantMembership` row today:
(a) `redeemInvite` in `src/app-layer/usecases/tenant-invites.ts` —
token-bound, email-bound, atomically consumed via an `updateMany`
with `acceptedAt IS NULL AND expiresAt > now()` predicate. A leaked
token is burnt on email mismatch.
(b) `createTenantWithOwner` in `src/app-layer/usecases/tenant-lifecycle.ts` —
platform-admin tenant bootstrap, gated by `PLATFORM_ADMIN_API_KEY`
(constant-time compared via `verifyPlatformApiKey`).
(c) `/api/auth/register` — credentials self-service signup (AUTH_TEST_MODE-gated).
Plus the legitimate SSO + SCIM provisioning paths. Every site is
allowlisted in `tests/guardrails/no-auto-join.test.ts` with a
one-line reason; a fourth-not-listed site fails CI.

**Middleware tenant-access gate.** `/t/:slug/**` and
`/api/t/:slug/**` require the JWT's `tenantSlug` claim to match the
URL's slug. Mismatch → `/no-tenant` (web) or `403 no_tenant_access`
(API). Uses the JWT claim only — no per-request DB hit. Carve-outs
for `/invite/<token>`, `/api/invites/**`, and `/no-tenant` itself.
Logic lives in `src/lib/auth/guard.ts::checkTenantAccess`.

**Last-OWNER protection — two layers.** Usecase layer
(`updateTenantMemberRole`, `deactivateTenantMember`) counts ACTIVE
OWNERs and throws `forbidden('Cannot demote/deactivate the last
OWNER...')`. DB trigger `tenant_membership_last_owner_guard` is the
backstop — raises SQLSTATE P0001 on any UPDATE or DELETE that would
leave a tenant with zero ACTIVE OWNERs, catching bypass attempts
(raw `deleteMany`, code paths that forget the check). The two-step
`transferTenantOwnership` flow uses this: promote the new OWNER
first (count=2), then demote the old (count=1, trigger satisfied).

**Invitation flow.** Admin POSTs to `/api/t/:slug/admin/invites` →
`createInviteToken` creates a 256-bit base64url token with 7-day
expiry. User clicks `/invite/<token>` → preview page → "Sign in to
accept" sets a 10-min HttpOnly cookie and redirects to `/login`.
After OAuth, the signIn callback reads the cookie and calls
`redeemInvite`. Step 1 (atomic claim) commits standalone so
Step 2 (email binding) can burn the invite on mismatch without
rolling back the claim — leaked tokens are unusable on first failed
attempt.

**See `docs/epic-1-access-control.md`** for the Epic 1 operator
runbook (verification commands, rollback procedures, how to add a
new tenant-membership creation path).

### RBAC & Permissions

- `src/lib/permissions.ts` — `PermissionSet` (granular UI flags) resolved from the user's role
- Built-in roles: `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `EDITOR`, `READER`, `AUDITOR` (Prisma enum `Role`)
- Custom roles: `TenantCustomRole` model with `permissionsJson` overrides, referenced via `TenantMembership.customRoleId`
- `appPermissions` on `RequestContext` is already custom-role–aware

### Observability

All structured logging, tracing, and metrics flow through `src/lib/observability/index.ts` (barrel export). Use `log(ctx, level, message, fields)` or `logger.info(...)` for logging. Use `traceUsecase()` / `traceOperation()` for OpenTelemetry spans. Never `console.log` in application code.

### Auth

NextAuth v4.24.14 (stable) is configured in `src/auth.ts`. Providers: Google OAuth, Microsoft Entra ID (via the v4 `azure-ad` provider — same OAuth endpoints, Microsoft renamed the product), SAML (via `src/app/api/auth/sso/`), and Credentials. The JWT carries `tenantId`, `role`, `mfaPending`, `memberships[]`, and the Epic C.3 `userSessionId`. Token refresh logic lives in `src/lib/auth/refresh.ts`.

**GAP-04 — type augmentation pattern.** `src/auth.ts` declares two module augmentations: `next-auth` for `Session.user` (id/tenantId/role/mfaPending/memberships) and `next-auth/jwt` for the full JWT shape (every custom field the codebase stores). Middleware reads typed `token.role` / `token.memberships` directly via `getToken({ req, secret })`. There are zero `as any` casts in the auth-critical path; the structural guardrail at `tests/guardrails/auth-stack-pinning.test.ts` fails CI if any are reintroduced.

**Compat shims.** `auth()` returns `Session | null` (alias for `getServerSession(authOptions)`) and `signOut({ redirectTo })` redirects to `/api/auth/signout?callbackUrl=…`. Both keep the 15+ server-component import sites stable across the v5→v4 migration. New code should import `getServerSession(authOptions)` directly to make the dependency explicit at each call site.

### Environment Validation

`src/env.ts` uses `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` for type-safe env vars. Tests set `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` to bypass this. Never add raw `process.env` access — add the var to `env.ts` first.

### Background Jobs (BullMQ)

Job definitions are in `src/app-layer/jobs/`. The executor registry is `src/app-layer/jobs/executor-registry.ts`. Jobs run inside `traceUsecase` spans and inherit request context.

### Billing & entitlements (GAP-18)

The codebase has two billing modes, decided by a single env var:

  • `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` set → **SaaS mode**. Per-tenant plan
    (`FREE` / `TRIAL` / `PRO` / `ENTERPRISE`) is read from
    `BillingAccount.plan` and enforced at the mutation boundary
    via `assertWithinLimit(ctx, resource)` from
    `src/lib/billing/entitlements.ts`. SaaS tenants without a
    `BillingAccount` row resolve to `FREE`.

  • `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` unset/empty → **self-hosted mode**.
    Every tenant resolves to `ENTERPRISE` and per-resource limits
    are unlimited. No DB query happens for plan resolution.

The decision is read once at module load. Today only `control`
creation is gated (FREE: 10, TRIAL/PRO: 100, ENTERPRISE: unlimited).
Adding a new gated resource is a one-line change in `PLAN_LIMITS`,
a `switch` arm in `getCurrentCount`, and one
`await assertWithinLimit(ctx, '<resource>')` call at the create-site.

**See `docs/billing.md`** for the full operator + developer runbook,
the reasoning behind plan limits, the failure-shape contract
(`forbidden('plan_limit_exceeded: …')` → 403), and the "what NOT to
do" list (no UI-only gating, no second mode-detection mechanism, no
duplicating the limits table).

## Testing Conventions

- **Unit tests**: Mock dependencies with `jest.mock()` declared **before** imports. Use `buildRequestContext()` helper from `tests/helpers/make-context.ts` to construct test contexts.
- **Integration tests**: Use `prismaTestClient()` and `resetDatabase()` from `tests/helpers/db.ts`. Hit a real DB — do not mock Prisma in integration tests.
- **Guard tests** (`tests/guards/`): Static analysis tests that enforce architectural rules (no `as any`, no unsafe patterns). These are regular Jest tests that scan source files with regex.
- **E2E tests**: Playwright in serial mode. Tests share state (tenantSlug, resource IDs) within a describe block. Use existing HTML `id` attributes — do not add `data-testid` attributes.
- `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` is set in `jest.setup.js` to prevent env loader crash in unit tests.
- Coverage thresholds: 60% global (branches, functions, lines, statements); checked on `npm run test:coverage`.

## Failing tests

A failing test on a branch is a failing test, full stop. "Pre-existing on
main" is a diagnosis, not a license to bypass it. The rule:

- **Run the affected test suites before claiming a task is done.** Don't
  rely on "my changes only touch X" — Jest projects, structural ratchets,
  and import graphs catch surprising regressions.

- **When a test fails, find the root cause first.** Check whether your
  change broke it; if not, check whether it's failing on `main` too. The
  goal is to know what the failure means, not to assign blame.

- **Pre-existing failures must be fixed, not bypassed.** If a suite is
  red on `main`, that's a bug — open a focused fix PR, link it from the
  current PR, and either (a) include the fix in the current PR if it's
  small and on-scope, or (b) explicitly call out the blocker in the PR
  description. Never silently admin-merge through a red test.

- **Never use `gh pr merge --admin` to push past failing CI** without
  the user's explicit authorisation for that specific PR. Required
  checks exist for a reason; the cost of pausing is low, the cost of
  shipping a regression to main is high.

- **Apply the same standard to dependency PRs.** A dependabot bump that
  breaks a test on `main` still needs the underlying breakage fixed,
  even though the bump itself is mechanical.

The exception: if the user has explicitly said "merge despite the
failures, I know what they are" for a specific PR, that authorisation
stands for that PR only — not as a precedent.

## Key Conventions

- **Zod schemas** for all API input validation live in `src/app-layer/schemas/` (backend) and `src/lib/schemas/` (shared).
- **Audit trail**: Call `logEvent()` from `src/app-layer/events/audit.ts` after mutating state. Entries are hash-chained — never write directly to the `AuditLog` table.
- **Error classes**: Use typed errors from `src/lib/errors/` rather than throwing raw `Error`.
- **i18n**: UI strings go through `next-intl`. Message files are in `messages/`. Server components use `getTranslations()`, client components use `useTranslations()`.
- **Path alias**: `@/` maps to `src/`. Always use this alias — never relative paths crossing layer boundaries.
- **Two `DATABASE_URL` vars**: `DATABASE_URL` points to PgBouncer (transaction-mode, used at runtime). `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` points directly to Postgres (used for Prisma migrations).
- **Page-section rhythm** (Roadmap-5 PR-9): the spacing scale
  (`tight` / `compact` / `default` / `section` / `page`) is rich, but
  vertical page rhythm wants only TWO answers most of the time.
    - **`space-y-section`** — between top-level page regions (page
      header, filter toolbar, primary table, footer toast). The
      24-32 px breath that says "this is a different kind of thing".
    - **`space-y-default`** — inside a card, between sibling fields,
      between rows in a panel. The 16 px breath that says "same kind
      of thing, next instance".
  Use `space-y-tight` / `space-y-compact` only inside dense field
  groups where the children are micro-elements (icon + label, status
  pills). The semantic-scale ratchet at
  `tests/guards/spacing-scale-discipline.test.ts` already bans raw
  numerics; this convention guides the choice between `default` and
  `section`.
- **Border tone discipline** (Roadmap-5 PR-10): three semantic
  border tones, each with a clear role.
    - **`border-border-subtle`** — DEFAULT. Structural separators
      (form-field outlines, table-cell separators, quiet panel
      boundaries, sidebar item dividers). If you have to ask
      "default or subtle?", the answer is subtle.
    - **`border-border-default`** — Reserved for surfaces that need
      explicit containment: card outer border, table outer border,
      modal/sheet boundary, popover/tooltip outline. The "this is a
      discrete surface" statement.
    - **`border-border-emphasis`** — Reserved for state: selected
      card, active panel, focused field, hovered click target. Tone
      that says "this is the one you mean".
  Forward enforcement at `tests/guards/border-tone-budget.test.ts`
  (budget ratchet that locks the current count and only ratchets
  down).
- **Action button vocabulary** (PR-5): three verbs, one per intent.
  Pick the one that matches what the click actually does. Never lead a
  label with `+ ` — the icon belongs to the button's `icon` slot, not
  the text.
    - **`Create {Entity}`** — minting a new top-level entity (`Create
      Risk`, `Create Asset`, `Create Audit`). Use this for the
      primary action on a list page's header and for "+ New" replacements.
    - **`Add {Entity}`** — inserting a child / attaching to a parent
      (`Add Document` on the vendor detail page, `Add Comment` on a
      task). The thing being added doesn't exist independently — it's
      tied to the open entity.
    - **`Link {Entity}`** — cross-entity association (`Link Risk`,
      `Link Control`, `Link Asset` on the traceability panel). The
      thing already exists; you're connecting it.
  Forward enforcement at `tests/guards/action-label-vocabulary.test.ts`.
- **Destructive-action vocabulary** (Roadmap-4 PR-9): every
  `<ConfirmDialog tone="danger">` confirmLabel MUST start with one of
  the canonical verbs below. Pick the one that matches the actual
  effect — the verb is the user's last clue before they commit.
    - **`Delete {Entity}`** — permanent erasure of a top-level entity
      or configuration (`Delete configuration`). The data is gone.
    - **`Remove {Item}`** — detach an item from a parent OR turn off
      an enrollment (`Remove MFA`, `Remove document`). Source row may
      live on.
    - **`Revoke {Credential}`** — invalidate an authority / credential
      (`Revoke API key`, `Revoke SCIM token`, `Revoke session`).
    - **`Discard {Draft}`** — abandon unsaved or draft state.
    - **`Archive {Entity}`** — soft delete with history preserved.
    - **`Unlink {Entity}`** / **`Detach {Entity}`** — break an
      association without deleting either side.
    - **`Reject {Request}`** — refuse an approval request or finding.
  Forward enforcement at `tests/guards/destructive-vocabulary.test.ts`.
- **Search placeholder vocabulary** (PR-9): every `<FilterToolbar
  searchPlaceholder>` value follows `Search {entityPlural}…`. One
  ellipsis (`…`, single character — not `...`). NEVER append a
  parenthetical hint like `(Enter)` / `(Press Enter)` — the
  `type="search"` input plus the FilterToolbar's commit-on-Enter +
  blur semantics are discoverable on their own; the parenthetical
  added visual noise without informational value. Forward enforcement
  at `tests/guards/search-placeholder-vocabulary.test.ts`. The same
  format applies to i18n `searchPlaceholder` values in `messages/`.

## Implementation notes

Every substantive prompt — architectural decisions, new features, security
or infrastructure changes, anything worth revisiting in six months — lands
a short markdown file in `docs/implementation-notes/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`
alongside the code + tests. Commit messages carry the `what + why`; these
notes carry the `design + decisions + tradeoffs` in a grep-friendly form.

**Default structure** (skip any section that doesn't apply):

```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD — <feature name>

**Commit:** `<sha> <commit subject>`

## Design
<architectural shape — diagrams or prose, 10-30 lines>

## Files
<table of files changed with one-line role per file>

## Decisions
<bullet list of non-obvious tradeoffs and why they went the way they did>
```

**Do NOT include a "Tests added" section** — the test files themselves
are the durable record. Duplicating counts into docs creates rot when the
test list moves.

**Skip** for small UI tweaks, config bumps, bug fixes that don't shift
architecture. The bar is "would a future engineer need the context?"

Existing examples: `docs/implementation-notes/2026-04-22-*.md`.

## UI Platform — Epics 51–60

The following epics established shared primitives, guardrail tests, and
contributor guides. **Always use the platform primitives** — never
hand-roll a replacement. Each section points to its decision-tree doc.

### Epic 51 — Design Tokens & Theme System

Use semantic token classes (`bg-bg-default`, `text-content-muted`,
`border-border-subtle`) instead of raw Tailwind color scales
(`bg-slate-800`, `text-slate-400`). Use `<Button>`, `<StatusBadge>`,
and `<EmptyState>` components instead of legacy `.btn` / `.badge` CSS
classes. See `docs/token-cheatsheet.md` and `docs/ui-buttons.md`.

### Epic 52 — DataTable Platform

Every list page must use `<DataTable>` from `@/components/ui/table`.
Never add raw `<table>` elements in app pages. Use the
`useListPagination` adapter for cursor-based APIs. See
`tests/guards/epic52-datatable-ratchet.test.ts`.

**List-page layout (the viewport-clamped scroll pattern):**
Wrap the page in `<ListPageShell>` from `@/components/layout/ListPageShell`
and pass `fillBody` to the primary `<DataTable>`. Result: the table
card fits the viewport, only the table body scrolls — page header,
filter toolbar, and pagination footer stay anchored. On mobile (<md)
the shell is a no-op and natural document scroll resumes.

```tsx
<ListPageShell>
  <ListPageShell.Header>...</ListPageShell.Header>
  <ListPageShell.Filters><FilterToolbar ... /></ListPageShell.Filters>
  <ListPageShell.Body>
    <DataTable fillBody data={...} columns={...} />
  </ListPageShell.Body>
</ListPageShell>
```

A new app page that imports `DataTable` MUST either wrap in
`<ListPageShell>` OR add itself to `EXEMPTIONS` in
`tests/guards/list-page-shell-coverage.test.ts` with a written
reason. Exemptions exist for multi-section dashboards (Coverage,
admin/api-keys, admin/notifications, admin/integrations) and
detail-page sub-tables / wizards (risks/import) where viewport-
clamping doesn't fit. See `docs/epic-52-list-page-shell.md` for the
decision tree.

### Entity-page architecture (`EntityListPage` + `EntityDetailLayout`)

Two composition shells live in `src/components/layout/` —
`EntityListPage` (list pages) and `EntityDetailLayout` (detail
pages). Both carry **layout, not business content**. Reach for them
whenever you build a new entity page; never re-introduce the inline
`<ListPageShell> + <FilterToolbar> + <DataTable>` block or the
inline back-link / title / tab-bar / loading-skeleton dance.

```tsx
// List page — controls reference impl: ControlsClient.tsx
<EntityListPage<Row>
  header={{ title, count, actions }}
  filters={{ defs, searchId, searchPlaceholder, toolbarActions }}
  table={{ data, columns, getRowId, onRowClick, emptyState, … }}
>
  {/* page-level modals/sheets sit as children */}
</EntityListPage>

// Detail page — controls reference impl: controls/[controlId]/page.tsx
<EntityDetailLayout
  back={{ href, label }}
  title={…}
  meta={…}
  actions={…}
  loading={…}
  error={…}
  empty={…}
  tabs={…}
  activeTab={…}
  onTabChange={…}
>
  {/* active-tab content owned by the page */}
</EntityDetailLayout>
```

The shells are reusable; the pages stay opinionated. Column defs,
filter defs (including runtime-derived options), data fetching,
mutations, optimistic updates, modals, sheets, permission gates,
and domain-specific tab bodies (e.g. `TraceabilityPanel`,
`LinkedTasksPanel`, `TestPlansPanel`) all stay in the page.

**When NOT to reach for these shells.**

  - Multi-section dashboards (already in the Epic 52 `EXEMPTIONS`
    list — Coverage, admin/api-keys, admin/notifications,
    admin/integrations).
  - Wizards / multi-step flows where the page isn't a single list or
    detail (risks/import).
  - Sub-tables nested inside a detail tab — `<DataTable>` directly
    is the right primitive there, not `<EntityListPage>`.

**Adoption ratchet.** Each adoption is locked by a structural test
that asserts the page mounts the shell and doesn't hand-roll the
inline composition: `controls-client-shell-adoption.test.ts` (list)
and `control-detail-shell-adoption.test.ts` (detail). When you
migrate a new entity page (risks / policies / vendors / audits /
…), add a sibling `*-shell-adoption.test.ts` next to the existing
two — same shape, same regression-class lock.

See `docs/implementation-notes/2026-04-30-entity-page-architecture.md`
for the unified architecture rationale and
`docs/implementation-notes/2026-04-30-entity-detail-layout-extraction.md`
for the detail-shell extraction.

### Epic 53 — Enterprise Filter System

Use `FilterToolbar` + `FilterProvider` + `useFilterContext` from
`@/components/ui/filter/` for list-page filtering. Never build ad-hoc
`useState` + manual URL sync. See
`src/components/ui/filter/GUIDE.md` and `docs/filters.md`.

### Epic 54 — Modal & Sheet Strategy

Use `<Modal>` for quick create/edit/confirm flows and `<Sheet>` for
inspect-and-edit without losing list context. Never hand-roll a
`fixed inset-0 bg-black/…` overlay. See `docs/modal-sheet-strategy.md`.

### Epic 55 — Combobox & Form Primitives

Use `<Combobox>` for selection lists, `<UserCombobox>` for people
pickers, `<RadioGroup>` for 2–5 visible choices, and wrap every
field with `<FormField>`. Never use raw `<select>` or
`<input className="input">` in app pages. See
`docs/combobox-form-strategy.md`.

### Epic 56 — Tooltip & Copy Primitives

Use `<Tooltip>` for hover/focus hints, `<InfoTooltip>` for help icons,
`<CopyButton>` / `<CopyText>` / `useCopyToClipboard` for clipboard.
Never use raw `navigator.clipboard` or add new `title=` attributes.
See `docs/tooltip-and-copy-strategy.md`.

### Epic 57 — Keyboard Shortcuts & Command Palette

Register shortcuts via `useKeyboardShortcut` — never
`document.addEventListener('keydown', …)`. Always supply a
`description`. See `docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md`.

### Epic 58 — Date Pickers

Use `<DatePicker>` for single dates and `<DateRangePicker>` for
ranges. Use `formatDate` / `formatDateTime` from `@/lib/format-date`
for display. Never use `<input type="date">` or raw
`toLocaleDateString`. See `docs/date-picker.md`.

### Epic 59 — Dashboard Charts

When adding or modifying charts/visuals on any dashboard page,
always use the shared chart platform. See `docs/charts.md` for the
decision tree. Never use raw `<svg>`, `<polyline>`, or inline
`style={{ width: \`\${pct}%\` }}` progress bars.

### Epic 60 — Shared Hooks & Polish Primitives

Import shared hooks from `@/components/ui/hooks` (barrel): `useLocalStorage`,
`useOptimisticUpdate`, `useEnterSubmit`, `useInputFocused`, `useScroll`,
`useScrollProgress`, `useInViewport`, etc. Use the polish primitives
`<Accordion>`, `<TabSelect>`, `<ToggleGroup>`, `<Slider>`,
`<NumberStepper>` for dense interaction areas. Never hand-roll a tab
bar, segmented filter row, `localStorage` cache, Enter-submit handler,
or `<input type="number">` stepper — reach for the shared primitive. See
`docs/epic-60-shared-hooks-and-polish.md` and the ratchet
`tests/guards/epic60-ratchet.test.ts`.

### Epic 60 — Automation Events & Dispatch (backend)

The event-driven backbone the rule-builder epic will stand on.
Import everything from `@/app-layer/automation` (single barrel).
Emit via `emitAutomationEvent(ctx, input)` — never construct
`AutomationExecution` rows directly from a usecase. When adding a
new event: add to `events.ts`, add the typed variant to
`event-contracts.ts`, emit from the usecase (or audit emitter), and
write a wiring test. Action handlers, rule-builder UI, and filter
DSL evolution all plug into clearly-marked seams — don't bypass
them. See `docs/automation-events.md` for the full contributor
guide and the decision-tree for extensions.

### Epic 67 — Destructive-action undo-toast convention

Every delete / unlink / remove flow in the product MUST use
`useToastWithUndo()` from `@/components/ui/hooks`. The hook returns
a stable `trigger` function that schedules the destructive commit
to fire 5 seconds after the click; during that window a custom
toast renders with an Undo button + animated countdown bar. Click
Undo and the timer is cancelled — the destructive write never
happens. The pending state lives at module scope (NOT in component
state) so commits survive client-side navigation, mirroring Gmail's
"undo send" UX.

The wired sites today: cross-entity unlink in `TraceabilityPanel`,
control-evidence + control-requirement unlink on the control detail
page, task link removal on the task detail page, and vendor
document removal on the vendor detail page. The structural ratchet
at `tests/guards/epic-67-rollout-coverage.test.ts` locks the wiring
in — adding a new site means appending it to `SITE_CONTRACTS`.

Never write a `confirm()` blocking dialog or a fire-and-forget
direct DELETE for a routine destructive action — those are the
anti-patterns Epic 67 replaces. Top-level entity deletion (tenant,
organization, framework) is the documented exception: cascading
consequences mean the 5-second window is too short, so use a
typed-confirmation modal there instead.

See `docs/destructive-actions.md` for the canonical wiring (snapshot
+ optimistic remove + trigger), the four invariants every site must
satisfy, message-tone rules, when NOT to use the pattern, and the
test layout (hook hardening at
`src/components/ui/hooks/__tests__/use-toast-with-undo.test.ts`,
baseline + UI tests under `tests/rendered/`, structural ratchet
under `tests/guards/`).

### Epic 68 — List virtualization

Single shared windowing primitive (`<VirtualizedList>`) wraps
`react-window` + `react-virtualized-auto-sizer`. Don't import
`react-window` directly — the primitive is the only seam.

Two production rollouts:

- **`<DataTable>` rows** — auto-virtualizes when `data.length > 1000`.
  Threshold raised from 100 → 1000 in a follow-up to scope auto-
  virtualization to genuinely large unpaginated tables (the lower
  threshold caused click-intercept regressions on medium-sized
  tables in Playwright). `virtualize={false}` opts out (Controls
  page contract). `virtualize={{ threshold: N }}` customises.
  Pages that legitimately need virtualization on smaller datasets
  should opt in explicitly. Falls back to the standard `<Table>`
  automatically when pagination, column resizing, column pinning,
  or empty/error/loading chrome is requested.
- **`<Combobox>` / `<UserCombobox>` dropdowns** — auto-virtualize
  when visible options exceed `COMBOBOX_VIRTUALIZE_THRESHOLD = 50`.
  cmdk's nav (which assumes items live in the DOM) is bypassed in
  the virtualized branch via a bespoke capture-phase keyboard layer
  bound to the search input — ArrowDown / ArrowUp / Home / End /
  Enter all flow through there with `aria-activedescendant` tracking.
  `<UserCombobox>` is a thin wrapper over `<Combobox>` so it gets
  virtualization for free.

Performance contract: any list above the threshold renders ≤30 row /
option nodes regardless of dataset size. The benchmark test in
`tests/rendered/combobox-virtualize.test.tsx` locks both the
DOM-count invariant AND a wall-clock budget (1000 options + open in
<2s on CI) so accidental regressions are caught.

See `docs/list-virtualization.md` for the rollout decision tree
(when to use the primitive directly vs reach for `<DataTable>` /
`<Combobox>`), the four `VirtualizedList` contract rules, the
DataTable + Combobox preserved/dropped feature lists, and the test
layout.
