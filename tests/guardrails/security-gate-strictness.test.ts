/**
 * GAP-05 — Structural ratchet for CI security gate strictness.
 * (Tightened 2026-05-12: high+ → moderate+.)
 *
 * The audit's GAP-05 finding noted that npm audit and Trivy gates
 * had been lowered (high → critical, CRITICAL,HIGH → CRITICAL) as a
 * temporary workaround to unblock CI while the Next.js 14 line
 * carried unfixable HIGH advisories. The Next 14 → 15.5 migration
 * cleared those advisories; the migration commit restored both gates
 * to their original strictness.
 *
 * 2026-05-12 the npm-audit gate was raised one further notch from
 * `--audit-level=high` to `--audit-level=moderate`. Moderate-severity
 * CVEs in production deps (postcss XSS, hono middleware bypass,
 * protobufjs decoding bugs) are the exact failure mode this gate
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * This guardrail asserts the gates STAY restored AND ratchets only
 * in the strictness direction:
 *
 *   • npm audit production-deps gate is `moderate` OR `low` (or
 *     `info` — anything tighter than `high`). The regression class
 *     this catches: a future PR dropping back to `high`, `critical`,
 *     or removing the gate entirely.
 *
 *   • Trivy gate declares CRITICAL,HIGH (or tighter). A future PR
 *     that downgrades to `CRITICAL` alone reintroduces the
 *     lowered-gate posture GAP-05 closed.
 *
 * A written rationale + an upgrade plan tied to a specific advisory
 * must accompany any future lowering, NOT a workaround.
