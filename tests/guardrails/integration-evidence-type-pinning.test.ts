/**
 * PR-1 structural ratchet — integration-created Evidence is mapped to the
 * narrow Prisma `EvidenceType.TEXT`, never cast from the wider
 * integration-layer vocabulary (`DOCUMENT|SCREENSHOT|LOG|CONFIGURATION|
 * REPORT`).
 *
 * Both writers that turn a `CheckResult` into an `Evidence` row —
 *   - `src/app-layer/jobs/automation-runner.ts`   (scheduled cron)
 *   - `src/app-layer/usecases/integrations.ts`    (manual run)
 * — previously did `type: evidencePayload.type as EvidenceType` (a bounded
 * but real cast). A stray cast would let a non-TEXT enum value reach the
 * column. This guard fails CI if the cast returns.
