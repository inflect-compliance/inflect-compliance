/**
 * Policy-coverage predicate FORWARD-LOCK.
 *
 * "A policy that counts" toward coverage / audit readiness has exactly ONE
 * definition: `@/lib/policy/coverage-predicate` (PUBLISHED + not deleted).
 * Before it, three scorers disagreed — the readiness pack counted APPROVED too,
 * the NIS2 scorer counted every status via a keyword match, and the coverage
 * summary ignored policies. This ratchet keeps them converged: every
 * policy-counting scorer MUST import the predicate and MUST NOT hand-roll a
 * policy-status filter on a `policy.findMany/count` query.
 *
 * NOTE: status-BREAKDOWN surfaces (DashboardRepository.getPolicySummary,
 * snapshot.ts) legitimately `groupBy status` to report per-status counts — they
 * are NOT "policies that count" scorers and are intentionally out of scope.
