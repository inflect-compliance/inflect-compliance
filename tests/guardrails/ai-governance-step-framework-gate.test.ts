/**
 * AI-governance onboarding-step framework-gate ratchet.
 *
 * The conditional AI_GOVERNANCE_SELF_ASSESSMENT step appears when an AI
 * framework is among the selected frameworks (or the company AI-systems flag
 * is set) — analogous to NIS2 → NIS2_SELF_ASSESSMENT. Since the framework
 * picker became data-driven (it now feeds the *canonical DB framework keys*
 * into the gate), the gate's hand-maintained `AI_FWS` set MUST stay in sync
 * with the keys the seed actually writes. A drift — renaming an AI framework
 * key in the seed without updating the gate, or the two gate copies (client +
 * server) diverging — would silently stop the step from appearing.
 *
 * This locks the linkage end-to-end:
 *   - every seeded AI framework key is a real key in the seed,
 *   - selecting it makes the step applicable (server gate, behavioural),
 *   - the client + server AI_FWS sets are identical and recognise each key.
