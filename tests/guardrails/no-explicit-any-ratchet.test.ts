/**
 * Epic C — `as any` count ratchet.
 *
 * The codebase has been progressively cleaned of unsafe `as any`
 * casts. This guardrail locks in the gain by tracking the total
 * count across `src/` and refusing to let it grow.
 *
 * ## Policy
 *
 *   • The current count (`CURRENT_BASELINE` below) is the ceiling.
 *     A PR that increases it FAILS this test with an actionable
 *     message pointing at the offending lines.
 *   • The baseline only moves DOWN. When a PR removes casts, it
 *     should lower `CURRENT_BASELINE` in the same diff (or risk
 *     a future regression silently re-using the slack).
 *   • Target: <50 total. Phase 3+ work continues to drive this
 *     downward toward the high-risk-perimeter zero-cast goal.
 *
 * ## How to fix a failure
 *
 *   1. Eliminate the new `as any` cast you introduced. Prefer
 *      Prisma-generated types, `z.infer<>`, an explicit interface,
 *      or `unknown` + runtime narrowing.
 *   2. If the cast is genuinely unavoidable (Prisma `Json` columns,
 *      third-party type buggery, dynamic indexing), tag the line
 *      with `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any -- <reason>`
 *      so the reviewer can see the intent. The cast still counts
 *      toward the baseline.
 *   3. Lower `CURRENT_BASELINE` in this file in the same PR if
 *      the count actually dropped (e.g. you removed more than you
 *      added). The ratchet only moves the floor downward.
 *
 * Test files (`tests/**`) are excluded — those are allowed to use
 * `any` for ergonomic mocking under a separate ESLint override.

 *
 *   • 274 → 175: Epic C Phase 1 (2026-04-30) — security-critical to
 *     zero, mechanical (prisma|db) cast sweep, raw-SQL row-recast
 *     cleanup in heavy data-path files, typed EntitlementError +
 *     ambient EdgeRuntime declaration. (Counting only code-level
 *     occurrences — docstring/comment mentions are excluded.)
 *   • 175 → 4: Roadmap-6 P1 (2026-05-22) — `as any` debt paydown
 *     across ~65 files: Prisma enum/Json typing in repositories,
 *     services and usecases; schema-derived (`z.infer`) input types
 *     at the API route ↔ usecase boundary; typed delegate adapters
 *     for dynamic model access; `instanceof` error narrowing. The
 *     remaining 4 are documented staged debt — onboarding's
 *     STEP_ORDER vs ONBOARDING_STEPS divergence (×3, a latent bug
 *     out of P1 scope) and retention-notifications' system-user gap
 *     (×1) — each carries an inline eslint-disable + reason.
