/**
 * Single-Prisma-major pin.
 *
 * The `claude/implement-login-O64VA` branch stranded on Prisma 5 while `main`
 * moved to Prisma 7 — a major skew that turned a stale branch into an
 * expensive, high-risk reconcile (see docs/branch-divergence-o64va-analysis.md).
 * This ratchet keeps the whole Prisma family on ONE major so a divergent line
 * can't silently pin a different one, and so an accidental caret-bump across a
 * major boundary fails CI at PR time instead of surfacing as runtime drift.
 *
 * Every `@prisma/*` package + the `prisma` CLI must resolve to `PINNED_MAJOR`.
 * Upgrading is a deliberate, documented act: bump `PINNED_MAJOR` here in the
 * SAME PR that bumps package.json, and follow docs/prisma-upgrade-path.md.
