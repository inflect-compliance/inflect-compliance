/**
 * Policy-template coverage + provenance ratchet.
 *
 * The global policy-template starter set is seeded from the inline
 * `policyTemplates` array in `prisma/seed.ts` into the `PolicyTemplate`
 * model (idempotent by title). This guard:
 *
 *   - locks the expanded domain coverage (the JupiterOne topic list was
 *     used only as a subject checklist — see the impl note);
 *   - PROVES the content is original, not copied from the CC-BY-SA-4.0
 *     source: none of JupiterOne's Mustache placeholders may appear in
 *     our seed. This is the load-bearing licensing guard — a future paste
 *     of their templated text trips it.
