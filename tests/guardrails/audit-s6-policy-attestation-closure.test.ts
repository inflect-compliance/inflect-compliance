/**
 * Audit Coherence S6 (closure lock, 2026-05-27) — Gap 6 (policy
 * attestation tracking) was shipped 2026-05-24 (Audit S4 sprint).
 * This ratchet locks the schema, usecase, and audit-event surface
 * so a future refactor can't silently strip the attestation chain.
 *
 * The original audit (2026-05-22) flagged ISO 27001 §7.3 as
 * requiring evidence that personnel acknowledged policies. The
 * `PolicyAcknowledgement` model + `policy-attestation.ts` usecase
 * close that gap. The verification doc dated 2026-05-25 listed
 * this as OPEN because it was written before S4 landed — this
 * ratchet is the authoritative record that the closure is real.
 *
 * Locks three layers:
 *
 *   1. Prisma model — PolicyAcknowledgement has the canonical
 *      shape (policyVersionId / userId / acknowledgedAt /
 *      tenantId) + the @@unique([policyVersionId, userId])
 *      idempotency guard.
 *   2. Usecase — attestPolicy / getPolicyAttestation /
 *      listPolicyAttestations all exported with the documented
 *      signatures.
 *   3. Attestation is GATED on the published version (a DRAFT
 *      or ARCHIVED version is rejected).
