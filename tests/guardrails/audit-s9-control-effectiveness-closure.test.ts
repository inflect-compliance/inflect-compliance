/**
 * Audit Coherence S9 (closure lock, 2026-05-27) — Gap 9 (control
 * effectiveness scoring) was shipped 2026-05-24. This ratchet locks
 * the surface so a future refactor can't silently drop the rolling
 * pass-rate aggregation or change its window default.
 *
 * The original audit (2026-05-22) flagged the lack of an
 * aggregation over `ControlTestRun` rows — auditors evaluating
 * operating effectiveness want a "pass rate over the last N runs"
 * number, but the only path was to read raw rows and compute by
 * eye. `computeControlEffectivenessMap` closes that.
 *
 * Effectiveness is consolidated behind ONE canonical batched function,
 * `computeControlEffectivenessMap`, which control health, control ROI,
 * and the residual suggestion all read (each previously reimplemented
 * or ignored the query). PR-R removed the gated single-control
 * `getControlEffectiveness` convenience wrapper (zero callers); the
 * read gate now lives at those call sites. This ratchet follows the
 * effectiveness signal to the canonical function so the honest-null +
 * window + COMPLETED-only invariants still can't silently regress.
 *
 * Locks the load-bearing pieces:
 *
 *   1. The exported `ControlEffectiveness` shape — controlId +
 *      passRate + total + passes + fails + inconclusive +
 *      windowDays.
 *   2. The 90-day default rolling window (matches the audit-
 *      readiness scoring convention).
 *   3. The canonical `computeControlEffectivenessMap` is exported and
 *      uses the Prisma `groupBy(['controlId', 'result'])` aggregation
 *      shape with the COMPLETED + executedAt-since-cutoff filters.
 *   4. The honest-null passRate (null on an empty window, never 0%).
 *   5. The read gate lives at the call sites (the single-control
 *      wrapper was removed in PR-R).
