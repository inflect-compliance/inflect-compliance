/**
 * Guardrail — the JWT membership payload stays bounded.
 *
 * The NextAuth JWT is a fixed-size credential carried in a cookie, not
 * a data store. The `jwt` callback in `src/auth.ts` embeds the user's
 * tenant + org memberships so the Edge middleware can authorize a slug
 * with no DB hit — but a user in very many tenants would otherwise
 * grow the cookie without bound (a latent overflow bug).
 *
 * The fix (2026-05-21): both membership arrays are capped at
 * `MAX_JWT_MEMBERSHIPS` and the over-cap case is flagged with
 * `membershipsTruncated` / `orgMembershipsTruncated` so the middleware
 * gate can defer a slug-miss to the authoritative server-side check.
 *
 * This ratchet fails CI if a future edit:
 *   - removes the `.slice(0, MAX_JWT_MEMBERSHIPS)` cap from either
 *     array (re-introducing the unbounded payload), or
 *   - bumps `MAX_JWT_MEMBERSHIPS` past a sane ceiling (defeating the
 *     bound by making the "cap" effectively infinite), or
 *   - drops the truncation flags the middleware relies on.
 *
 * The checks scan the raw source: every pattern asserted here
 * (`export const MAX_JWT_MEMBERSHIPS = <n>`, `.slice(0, …)`) is
 * executable-code syntax that never appears in prose, so no
 * comment-stripping is needed.
