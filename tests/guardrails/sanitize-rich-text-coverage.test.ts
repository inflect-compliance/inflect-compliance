/**
 * Guardrail: Epic C.5 / D.2 — rich-text sanitiser coverage (structural).
 *
 * ─── Why this is structural, not a numeric floor ────────────────────
 *
 * The previous incarnation kept a hand-curated list of usecases plus
 * `SANITISER_COVERAGE_FLOOR = 8` — a MINIMUM. That was a weak signal:
 * the floor went green while the real coverage drifted to 15 sanitised
 * usecases, and — worse — a *new* rich-text write path could land with
 * no sanitiser and the floor-of-8 would never notice (the eight known
 * entries were all still present). "At least N" cannot prove
 * completeness.
 *
 * This version derives the rich-text inventory from an authoritative,
 * already-maintained registry: `ENCRYPTED_FIELDS` in
 * `src/lib/security/encrypted-fields.ts`. Epic B REQUIRES every
 * business-content text field to be listed there (it drives
 * encrypt-on-write / decrypt-on-read). So:
 *
 *   - every encrypted business-content model IS a rich-text surface;
 *   - this guardrail asserts every such model is CLASSIFIED — either
 *     `RICH_TEXT_COVERAGE` (a usecase sanitises it),
 *     `NON_RICH_TEXT_MODELS` (the encrypted value is not user-supplied
 *     rich text — e.g. a generated secret), or `KNOWN_UNCOVERED`
 *     (a real, named gap, ratcheting to zero);
 *   - a NEW encrypted model — which a new rich-text field forces into
 *     `ENCRYPTED_FIELDS` — that is in NONE of the three buckets fails
 *     this test. That is the completeness guarantee the floor lacked.
 *
 * Server-side sanitisation must run BEFORE the row is persisted:
 * render-time sanitisation alone leaves the row dangerous to PDF
 * export, audit-pack share links, and SDK consumers reading it
 * verbatim.

 * Keyed by Prisma model name (matching `ENCRYPTED_FIELDS`). When a new
 * encrypted business-content model lands, add it here (or to one of
 * the two exclusion maps below) — the completeness test fails until
