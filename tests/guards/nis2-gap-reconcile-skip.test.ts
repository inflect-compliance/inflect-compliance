/**
 * PR-BB item 1 — the NIS2 plain-CONTROL_GAP reconcile skip, CONFIRMED.
 *
 * NIS2 gap-lifecycle remediations (CONTROL_CREATE / plain-TASK) spawn tasks
 * with `type: 'CONTROL_GAP'` and `controlId: null` — they carry no control to
 * re-attest. `reconcileTaskSource` deliberately does NOT reconcile those: the
 * gap self-assessment ANSWER is the source of truth, and closing a nudge task
 * must not silently flip a question the tenant never answered. Only NIS2
 * CONTROL_LINK remediations (which carry a real `controlId`) re-attest.
 *
 * That is the intended product behaviour, re-confirmed in PR-BB rather than
 * wired to advance the gap. It is locked here because the skip is *invisible*
 * — it's the absence of a call — so a future "helpful" reconciler could add it
 * without anyone noticing the self-assessment had started answering itself.
 * Changing this must be a deliberate act that updates this test.
