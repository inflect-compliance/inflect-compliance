/**
 * Roadmap-12 PR-6 — NavItem active-state discipline.
 * (R13-PR5 evolution: text-content-emphasis → text-[--brand-default].)
 *
 * The active row is the one telling you which page you're on. It
 * has to read as "settled" — not louder than the surrounding rows,
 * not quieter. Conviction expressed through four co-operating
 * tokens, no single one shouting:
 *
 *   1. `text-[var(--brand-default)]` — yellow letters on METRO,
 *      orange letters on PwC. R12-PR6 originally locked
 *      `text-content-emphasis` here (one rung brighter than muted,
 *      held permanently). R13-PR5 evolves to brand-coloured letters
 *      so the active page is visually unmissable from across the
 *      desk. Both colours clear WCAG AA on the brand-subtle wash.
 *
 *   2. `bg-[var(--brand-subtle)]` — a brand-tinted wash, ~9% (PwC
 *      orange) or ~18% (METRO yellow) over the page bg. This is
 *      what distinguishes ACTIVE from HOVER — hover shows just
 *      the band; active commits with the wash. The wash is the
 *      "you are here" claim.
 *
 *   3. `before:opacity-100` — the brand-gradient capsule band
 *      from R12-PR5, held permanently at full opacity. Same
 *      mechanism as hover, but un-gated. The band is the
 *      jewellery.
 *
 *   4. `font-medium` — one weight up from regular (400 → 500).
 *      The smallest possible step. Anything bolder (600+) reads
 *      as a heading, not a row label. The weight bump is what
 *      lets the eye PICK the active row at a glance without
 *      reading; it parses as "denser ink".
 *
 * Why none of these alone, or fewer of them?
 *   - Just the band: looks identical to hover. No "settled"
 *     state.
 *   - Just the bg: looks like the row's been selected for a
 *     batch action.
 *   - Just the text colour change: too subtle on light theme.
 *   - Just font-weight: reads as a header, not a row.
 *
 * The conviction comes from all four firing TOGETHER. This
 * ratchet locks all four.
