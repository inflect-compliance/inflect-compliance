/**
 * Roadmap-2 PR-10 — skeleton-shape parity.
 *
 * Skeletons should be the page in negative — a list page shows
 * row skeletons of the right column widths, a detail page shows
 * hero + tab-bar + body skeleton. Several skeleton primitives
 * already exist (`SkeletonDetailPage`, `SkeletonTable`,
 * `SkeletonCard`, `ShimmerDots`); they were correct in pieces and
 * inconsistent in composition. This PR locks the WIRING so the
 * layout primitives own the choice — pages don't decide the
 * skeleton shape per call site.
 *
 * What this ratchet locks in
 *
 *   1. `<EntityDetailLayout loading>` renders the canonical
 *      `DetailLoadingSkeleton` body shape (hero + tab-bar +
 *      content card) — never a generic spinner. Removing the
 *      skeleton-render path from the shell would silently
 *      regress every detail page's loading state.
 *
 *   2. `<DataTable loading>` exposes the `loading` prop so the
 *      table draws its own skeleton rows of the right column
 *      widths. Pages that own a list view don't reach for
 *      `<SkeletonTable>` directly — they pass `loading={true}`
 *      through to the table, which paints the negative shape.
 *
 *   3. The `loading` slot is documented in `EntityListPage`'s
 *      table prop pick — passing `loading` flows through to
 *      DataTable. Pages that DO want a custom skeleton (rare,
 *      e.g. multi-section dashboards) opt out by simply not
 *      passing `loading` and rendering their own.
 *
 * What this ratchet does NOT police
 *
 *   Custom dashboards (Coverage, admin/api-keys, admin/notifications,
 *   admin/integrations) compose multiple sections — they render
 *   their own skeletons because the layout primitives can't
 *   predict the multi-section shape. They're explicitly out of
 *   scope and not on this ratchet's adoption list.
 *
 *   Dynamic-imported components (e.g. RiskTreatmentPlanCard,
 *   TraceabilityPanel) legitimately pass `<SkeletonCard>` /
 *   `<SkeletonRow>` as their `loading:` placeholder. That's the
 *   right pattern — the chunk hasn't loaded yet so the parent
 *   layout can't paint the right shape.
