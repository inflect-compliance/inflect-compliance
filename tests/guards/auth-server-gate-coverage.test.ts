/**
 * Auth server-gate coverage — the load-bearing integration tests.
 *
 * Playwright runs with `AUTH_TEST_MODE=1` (see
 * `tests/e2e/README.md → Server-mode invariant`), which bypasses
 * per-email rate-limit and `AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`. The
 * server enforcement of those gates is covered by real-mode
 * integration tests instead — these files are the documented
 * reason we don't run a sibling `playwright.real-auth.config.ts`.
 *
 * This guard locks the decision structurally: if a future PR
 * deletes one of these integration tests, the gap reopens and a
 * real-auth Playwright config (with SMTP catcher + Compose
 * service + second CI job) becomes worth reconsidering. Without
 * this guard, the deletion would be invisible to PR review until
 * a regression slipped through.
 *
 * If you delete a file from this list intentionally: edit the
 * list AND `tests/e2e/README.md → Why not a sibling
 * playwright.real-auth.config.ts?` in the same PR, and explain
 * what replaces it.
