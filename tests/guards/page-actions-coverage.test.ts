/**
 * Roadmap-8 PR-11 — page-action coverage ratchet.
 *
 * Two primitives sit on the shelf for page-header action clusters:
 *
 *   • `<PageActions>` (Roadmap-3 PR-1) — locks the geometry of the
 *     cluster: `flex flex-wrap-reverse items-center justify-end
 *     gap-tight min-h-9`. Every cluster shares the same right-edge
 *     spacing and wrap behaviour.
 *
 *   • `<ActionCluster>` (v2-PR-14) — TypeScript-typed primitive
 *     enforcing ≤1 primary + ≤1 secondary + N overflow items. The
 *     prop shape makes "two primaries" a compile-time error rather
 *     than a design lapse.
 *
 * Both are well-built. Both have zero in-app adopters. R7-PR1's
 * primary-action budget catches some of the symptoms of overcrowded
 * clusters but doesn't enforce the cluster itself.
 *
 * This ratchet is the structural lock for the future migration:
 *   1. Both primitives exist and export the expected API.
 *   2. The PageActions primitive carries the locked geometry
 *      (`flex flex-wrap-reverse items-center justify-end gap-tight
 *      min-h-9`) — a future "let's tighten this" PR can't silently
 *      change the recipe without updating the assertion.
 *   3. ActionCluster's typed `primary?: ActionItem` /
 *      `secondary?: ActionItem` prop shape is preserved — a future
 *      PR can't widen the type to `primary?: ActionItem |
 *      ActionItem[]` and reopen the regression.
 *
 * Migration of consumer pages onto these primitives is left as
 * follow-up work — the consumer migration registry pattern from
 * R7-PR9 is the right shape when/if a future round picks it up.
