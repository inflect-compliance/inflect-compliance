/**
 * Dependency risk-review ratchet.
 *
 * `docs/dependency-risk-review.md` is a periodic security review of
 * dependencies with CVE-active history or a large blast radius. The
 * review verdict for each package is: which `package.json` section
 * it belongs in, and which major it must stay on.
 *
 * This guard locks that verdict structurally. If a future change:
 *
 *   - moves a reviewed runtime package into `devDependencies`
 *     (the `Dockerfile`'s `npm prune --omit=dev` would strip it
 *     from the production image → prod crash CI can't catch), or
 *   - drops a reviewed package entirely, or
 *   - downgrades it below the reviewed major,
 *
 * the guard fails and points the author back at the review doc.
 *
 * It does NOT pin exact versions — in-major patch/minor bumps stay
 * free. It only enforces the section + the major floor, which is
 * the part the review actually reasoned about.
 *
 * When a new package is audited, add it to REVIEWED in the same
 * diff that adds its section to docs/dependency-risk-review.md.
