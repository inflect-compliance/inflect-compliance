/**
 * Roadmap-9 PR-8 — HeroMetric canonical home.
 *
 * Per user directive (R9 north-star locked 2026-05-11):
 * canonicalize `<HeroMetric>` as the dashboard-masthead primitive.
 * Don't retire it; document the canonical home and lock the
 * boundary so it doesn't spread to surfaces where the 72px metric
 * would feel out of place (admin pages, detail pages, modals).
 *
 * Today the primitive has exactly one consumer:
 * `src/app/t/[tenantSlug]/(app)/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`
 * — the main tenant dashboard masthead. The 72px value carries the
 * executive verdict (overall compliance score / readiness percent).
 * That's the right home: a 72px number reads as "the headline
 * answer" only in a masthead context.
 *
 * What this ratchet locks:
 *
 *   1. The primitive file exists with the locked 72px / hero-tier
 *      typography contract.
 *   2. The canonical home (DashboardClient) mounts it.
 *   3. No OTHER file in src/app reaches for it. A future PR
 *      proposing a second consumer must add the path to
 *      ADDITIONAL_HOMES with a written rationale.
 *
 * Why a registry instead of "ban everywhere but X":
 *   • R10 (delight round) may extend the masthead pattern to the
 *     org-level dashboard. ADDITIONAL_HOMES is the explicit
 *     extension surface — adding `src/app/org/.../dashboard/...`
 *     when the time comes is a one-line ratchet diff that documents
 *     the new home rather than silently widening the ban.
 *   • The 72px is a load-bearing typographic decision. Spreading
 *     it casually (e.g. a 72px control count on a detail page)
 *     dilutes the masthead signal.
