/**
 * Roadmap-2 PR-1 — single AppShell discipline.
 *
 * Until this PR there were two near-identical shells:
 *   • `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`     (tenant /t/:slug/(app))
 *   • `src/components/layout/OrgAppShell.tsx`  (org /org/:slug)
 *
 * Plus a hand-rolled header on `t/[tenantSlug]/(app)/admin/page.tsx`
 * that bypassed `PageHeader` entirely. Three shells where there
 * should be one. The roadmap collapsed all three into a single
 * `<AppShell variant="…">` primitive — this ratchet locks it in.
 *
 * What this ratchet detects
 *   1. The deleted `OrgAppShell.tsx` MUST stay deleted. A future PR
 *      that resurrects it (or adds a third sibling shell) fails CI.
 *   2. Any `from '@/components/layout/OrgAppShell'` import is a
 *      compile-time + test-time error.
 *   3. The unified `AppShell` accepts a `variant` prop (the union
 *      type that gates the sidebar slot).
 *   4. Both consumer layouts (tenant + org) mount the unified
 *      `<AppShell>` — never their own bespoke chrome.
 *
 * What this ratchet does NOT police
 *   The `unauth` surfaces (login, error, no-tenant, not-found) and
 *   the `print` surfaces (SoAPrintView) are intentionally outside
 *   the shell — they have no sidebar and no app chrome. Adding
 *   shell variants for them is pretense, not unification, and is
 *   explicitly out of scope.
