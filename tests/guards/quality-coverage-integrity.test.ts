/**
 * Quality-coverage capstone — the meta-ratchet.
 *
 * The quality roadmap closed three governance gaps, each with a
 * structural surface that holds the gain:
 *
 *   1. The per-layer coverage floors + the never-lowered ratchet
 *      (`coverage-ratchet.test.ts`, `jest.thresholds.json`).
 *   2. The E2E coverage manifest for the four browser-shaped UI
 *      surfaces that were explicitly deferred to Playwright
 *      (`e2e-coverage-manifest.test.ts`).
 *   3. The two policy / portfolio docs that explain WHY the
 *      enforced numbers are what they are
 *      (`coverage-policy.md`, `test-portfolio.md`).
 *
 * THIS test guards the guards: it fails CI if any one of those
 * surfaces is deleted, renamed, or gutted to a no-op, and if the
 * load-bearing facts inside them are removed. A contributor who
 * removes a quality-coverage surface must reckon with a red
 * meta-ratchet — the gap cannot silently reopen.
 *
 * Sibling of `ci-pipeline-integrity.test.ts`,
 * `observability-reliability-integrity.test.ts`,
 * `verification-integrity.test.ts`,
 * `codebase-hygiene-integrity.test.ts`, and
 * `dependency-governance-integrity.test.ts` — same "guard the
 * guards" pattern, the quality-coverage domain.
