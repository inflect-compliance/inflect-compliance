/**
 * Structural ratchet — the BullMQ worker is actually deployed.
 *
 * REGRESSION CLASS
 * ----------------
 * The app enqueues background jobs and `schedules.ts` defines 12
 * repeatable crons (task-due reminders, evidence expiry, retention
 * sweeps, the notification digest, …). All of that depends on a
 * separate long-running process: `scripts/worker.ts` (the BullMQ
 * worker) plus `scripts/scheduler.ts` (registers the repeatables).
 *
 * For a long time NEITHER ran in any Docker Compose deployment:
 * `entrypoint.sh` started only `next start`, no Compose file had a
 * `worker` service, and the worker scripts were not even in the
 * production image. Every scheduled job silently never fired and
 * enqueued jobs piled up in Redis — while every test stayed green,
 * because nothing asserted the worker was deployed.
 *
 * This guard makes the worker's deployment non-optional:
 *   1. Every production-like Compose file has a `worker` service
 *      that runs the scheduler then the worker.
 *   2. The Dockerfile builds the worker bundle and ships it.
 *   3. `package.json` carries the `build:worker` script and the
 *      build script exists.
 *
 * Pure static analysis — reads the Compose files, Dockerfile and
 * package.json.
