/**
 * Polish PR-10 — state-coverage ratchet (loading + empty).
 *
 * The states a user sees most often during failure deserve the
 * most polish. Loading and empty states are where polish either
 * compounds or evaporates — they're usually the surfaces a user
 * sees during their *most frustrated* moments.
 *
 * What this ratchet enforces
 *
 *   1. Every dashboard file (page.tsx or *Client.tsx under any
 *      `dashboard/` directory) MUST reference `SkeletonDashboard`
 *      from `@/components/ui/skeleton` if the file has an
 *      `if (loading)` branch. Hand-rolled `<div className="p-12
 *      text-center animate-pulse">Loading…</div>` is banned.
 *
 *   2. Every list-page client (under `src/app/.../page.tsx` whose
 *      filename matches `*Client.tsx` and contains a DataTable
 *      reference) SHOULD reference one of the Skeleton primitives
 *      when it has an `if (loading)` branch — but DataTable's
 *      built-in `loading` prop also satisfies this, so the rule is
 *      lighter here.
 *
 * What this ratchet does NOT police
 *   Detail pages — they delegate loading to `EntityDetailLayout
 *   loading`, which already paints `DetailLoadingSkeleton` from
 *   the shell.
 *
 *   Server components — they render synchronously, no loading
 *   branch needed.
 *
 * Pairs with:
 *   - src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx (the SkeletonDashboard /
 *     SkeletonTable / SkeletonDetailTabs primitives).
