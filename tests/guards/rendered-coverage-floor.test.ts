/**
 * Rendered / browser coverage floor — a STAGED UPWARD ratchet.
 *
 * Roadmap-4 made the behavioural-coverage registry an append-only
 * list of named high-risk primitives. What it did NOT do is stop the
 * rendered- and E2E-test *population* from shrinking: a PR could
 * delete a dozen `tests/rendered/` files and every structural
 * ratchet would stay green.
 *
 * This guard is the opposite of the `as any` ratchet. That one is a
 * downward ratchet — debt must only shrink. This is an UPWARD
 * ratchet — real-behaviour verification must only grow:
 *
 *   1. The count of rendered behavioural tests, E2E specs, and
 *      registered high-risk primitives must each stay AT OR ABOVE a
 *      floor. Deleting verification trips CI.
 *   2. A slack sentinel: when the live count runs well above its
 *      floor, the floor MUST be raised in the same PR. That is the
 *      "staged" part — added verification is locked in as the new
 *      minimum, so a later PR cannot silently spend the surplus.
 *
 * Floors only ever move UP. After a PR that adds rendered/E2E tests,
 * raise the matching floor here to the new count.
 *
 * See docs/verification-policy.md and docs/frontend-assurance-model.md.

// Bumped 126 → 135 by the edit-columns gear-fix repro test +
// other recent additions across the parity roadmap PRs.
//
// R31 (Bundle 1) — adjusted 135 → 134. The
// `tests/rendered/canvas-help-strip.test.tsx` rendered test
// was retired alongside the `CanvasHelpStrip` component (the
// "one message per state" design verdict moved the onboarding
// affordance into the empty-state hint at canvas-bottom-centre).
// This is the documented exception the rendered-floor ratchet
// explicitly contemplates: "if a test was legitimately merged
// or renamed, account for it." The floor will resume its
// upward-only ratchet from 134 on the next addition.
// Raised 134 → 143 (2026-06-03): button icon-as-child row test +
// accumulated rendered-test gains since the last bump.
// Raised 143 → 152 (2026-06-06): asset/risk modal-field, asset-criticality,
// and asset-KPI-trendline rendered tests.
