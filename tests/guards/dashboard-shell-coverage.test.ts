/**
 * Roadmap-8 PR-8 — DashboardLayout coverage ratchet.
 *
 * `<DashboardLayout>` (v2-PR-6) is the composition shell for
 * dashboard composites — pages composed of multiple metric / chart /
 * list cards in a vertical-section cadence. It sits alongside
 * `<EntityListPage>` (lists) and `<EntityDetailLayout>` (detail) as
 * the third public layout primitive.
 *
 * Six dashboard composites already adopt it:
 *   • Main tenant dashboard (DashboardClient)
 *   • Risks dashboard
 *   • Controls dashboard
 *   • Tasks dashboard
 *   • Tests dashboard
 *   • Vendors dashboard
 *
 * One known dashboard composite still hand-rolls its layout:
 *   • Coverage (CoverageClient)
 *
 * R7-PR4's FilterToolbar EXEMPTIONS list Coverage as "multi-section
 * dashboard". That framing is now wrong — once Coverage migrates to
 * `<DashboardLayout>`, it stops being multi-section-by-accident and
 * starts being multi-section-by-design.
 *
 * This ratchet:
 *   1. Locks the 6 adopters via a registry — strip-and-revert is
 *      caught by the assertion that `adopted: true` files actually
 *      mount the shell.
 *   2. Lists Coverage as `adopted: false, pending: true` so the
 *      migration in R8-PR9 flips the flag.
 *
 * Pairs with `entity-detail-layout-coverage.test.ts` (R7-PR9
 * registry pattern, copied here for the dashboard shell).
