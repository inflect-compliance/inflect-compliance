/**
 * R17-PR12 — dashboard first-paint rise-in choreography.
 *
 * Before R17, DashboardLayout's outer wrapper carried a bare
 * 150ms `animate-fadeIn`. The eye barely registered it — felt
 * like "the page just appeared." PR-12 swaps it for a 600ms
 * ease-out animation that combines a 0→1 opacity ramp with an
 * 8px translateY-from-below. The dashboard now reads as
 * "composing itself" on first paint rather than "popping in."
 *
 * Three load-bearing invariants:
 *
 *   1. The `dashboard-rise-in` keyframe is registered with the
 *      exact opacity + translateY shape. 8px is the smallest
 *      distance the eye still registers as motion at 600ms;
 *      larger reads as jumpy on a content-heavy page.
 *
 *   2. The animation utility runs at 600ms ease-out (one-shot,
 *      no `infinite`). Slow enough for the eye to register;
 *      fast enough that an impatient user doesn't wait.
 *      ease-out makes the motion DECELERATE into its final
 *      position — feels like landing, not stopping.
 *
 *   3. `<DashboardLayout>` uses the new animation. The 7 pages
 *      that consume DashboardLayout (executive dashboard, tests
 *      / risks / controls / tasks / vendors / coverage dashboards)
 *      all get the polished first-paint feel for free.
 *
 * The global `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` rule in
 * `tokens.css` flattens the duration to 1ms automatically — no
 * per-component opt-in.
