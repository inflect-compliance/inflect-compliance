/**
 * Roadmap-8 PR-5 — badge density ratchet.
 *
 * Premium products lean on ONE primary state badge per row. When two
 * loud `<StatusBadge>` cells sit side-by-side in a list view, the
 * eye fights to identify which is the dominant state signal — both
 * read as competing alarms. The visual remedy is the `tone="subtle"`
 * variant (R6-PR8 + StatusBadge primitive) which keeps the
 * tone-coded color but quietens the bg into the row chrome.
 *
 * This ratchet enforces TWO disciplines:
 *
 *   1. **Per-cell density.** No `<DataTable>` cell renderer should
 *      contain more than ONE `<StatusBadge>`. Multi-badge cells
 *      were the source of the worst row-noise we saw — three loud
 *      pills crammed into one column.
 *
 *   2. **Per-file budget.** Files mounting `<DataTable>` get a
 *      per-file ceiling on TOTAL `<StatusBadge>` JSX elements,
 *      capped at the post-PR-5 production count. Direction of
 *      travel is one-way down: future migrations to subtle tone or
 *      to plain inline text drop the count, not raise it.
 *
 * Today's PR also demotes specific secondary badges:
 *
 *   • `findings/FindingsClient.tsx` row status → `tone="subtle"`
 *     (the loud severity column is the primary signal).
 *   • `audits/AuditsClient.tsx` checklist result badge →
 *     `tone="subtle"` (it restates the Combobox above it).
 *
 * The `tone="subtle"` count is informational; the ratchet doesn't
 * police it directly. Use the budget assertion to ratchet down
 * solid-tone counts as migrations land.
