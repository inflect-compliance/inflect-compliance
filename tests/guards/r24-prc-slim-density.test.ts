/**
 * R24-PR-C — Slim radius re-tune ratchet.
 *
 * R22-PR-A took the button radius from `rounded-lg` (12px) to
 * `rounded-[10px]`. R24-PR-C tightens one more step: 10px → 8px.
 * 8px sits at the boundary between "gentle modern" and "carved
 * card" — far enough from a hard right angle to read soft, far
 * enough from a pill to read deliberate.
 *
 * Why ratchet: a future PR that softens the radius back to 10px
 * or 12px would lose the R24 slim signal without anyone noticing
 * in code review. The five touched files (button + input + date-
 * picker trigger + control-variants + button.tsx disabled
 * fallback) must move in lockstep — they're the chrome-parity
 * surface.
 *
 * Scope clarification — what PR-C deliberately did NOT touch:
 *   - Heights (h-9 default). Form-control parity locked at h-9
 *     by R20-PR-A; dropping the button to h-8 would break Input
 *     alignment in filter toolbars. A later roadmap can drop the
 *     whole control family to h-8 in lockstep.
 *   - `gap-tight` token (8px). 287 consumers across the codebase
 *     would ripple if changed. Out of R24's scope.
 *   - Tracking + weight ladder (R20-PR-C / R20-PR-E). Glass
 *     materials don't change typography opinions.
