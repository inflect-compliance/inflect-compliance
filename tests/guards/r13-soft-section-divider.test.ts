/**
 * Roadmap-13 PR-10 — Section divider as soft gradient.
 *
 * R12-PR3 shipped section dividers as a flat `border-t
 * border-border-subtle/40` — a hard 1px line at ~20% effective alpha.
 * Honest and quiet, but architectural; the line reads as a STAMPED
 * seam between sections.
 *
 * R13-PR10 evolves the divider to a `::before` pseudo-element
 * painted with a horizontal gradient:
 *
 *   linear-gradient(90deg, transparent, --border-subtle, transparent)
 *
 * The line fades in from transparent at each edge to
 * `--border-subtle` at center and back to transparent. The in-and-out
 * fade reads as BREATH between sections, not as a hard seam. The
 * sidebar inhales between Govern / Comply / Manage instead of
 * stamping a rule between them.
 *
 * Why a `::before` pseudo (not a `border-image: linear-gradient`)?
 *   - `border-image` works but loses the `:focus-visible` /
 *     `:hover` state targeting we may want later.
 *   - The `::before` overlay is a proper sub-element we can style
 *     freely — opacity, blur, even animation — without affecting
 *     the wrapper's box model.
 *
 * Why peak at `--border-subtle` (theme token)?
 *   - The token is already alpha-tuned per theme (METRO navy @ 50%,
 *     PwC warm gray @ 60%). The gradient fade at edges drops
 *     effective brightness to ~25-30% at peak — quieter than the
 *     R12 flat ~20%, but the in-and-out fade is what makes it feel
 *     like a sigh rather than a hard rule.
 *
 * Why absolute-positioned (`before:absolute before:top-0`)?
 *   - The line sits on the wrapper's exact top edge regardless of
 *     content. A `before:block before:h-px` flow-positioned
 *     approach would push content down by 1px on divided sections
 *     only, causing 1px alignment drift between first-section
 *     (undivided) and later sections (divided).
 *
 * R12-PR3 invariants preserved:
 *   - `isFirst` suppresses the divider.
 *   - Section header recipe (10px, tracking-0.12em, etc.) unchanged.
 *   - JSX shape (`<div>` wrapper with conditional divider class).
 *
 * The R12-PR3 ratchet's "divider recipe" assertion is updated in
 * the same diff to accept either the R12 (`border-t`) or R13
 * (`::before` gradient) form; a future regression that drops both
 * is caught.
