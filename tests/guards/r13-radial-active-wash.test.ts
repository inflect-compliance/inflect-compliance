/**
 * Roadmap-13 PR-11 — Radial brand wash on the active row.
 *
 * R12-PR6 shipped the active row's background as a uniform
 * `bg-[var(--brand-subtle)]` — a warm-primary tinted wash sitting
 * evenly across the row. Honest, but flat: the row reads as "a
 * coloured rectangle" rather than "a row LIT by the band".
 *
 * R13-PR11 evolves the wash to a RADIAL gradient that originates
 * at the row's left edge (where the band lives) and fades to
 * transparent at the right:
 *
 *   bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_left,
 *                       var(--brand-secondary-subtle),
 *                       transparent 75%)]
 *
 * The navy radial bleeds out from the band — feels like the band
 * is leaking light into the row, fading toward the right edge. The
 * eye reads this as "lit object on a surface", which is the
 * physical metaphor every premium nav design converges on.
 *
 * Two consequential changes from R12-PR6:
 *
 *   1. SHAPE: uniform → radial-from-left.
 *   2. HUE FAMILY: warm primary (--brand-subtle) → cool secondary
 *      (--brand-secondary-subtle). The wash now matches the band's
 *      hue family. The warm/cool contrast is preserved by R13-PR5's
 *      brand-coloured label (text-[var(--brand-default)] — warm
 *      yellow/orange), so the row still has the temperature
 *      duality the eye reads as "object on surface".
 *
 * The R12-PR6 ratchet's bg-wash assertion is updated in the same
 * diff to accept either form (the R12 uniform `bg-[var(--brand-
 * subtle)]` OR the R13 radial gradient). A future regression that
 * drops both leaves no wash at all — still caught.
 *
 * What this ratchet does NOT police:
 *
 *   - The exact fade stop (75%). Tuning is allowed within the
 *     "fades to transparent at the right edge" intent.
 *   - The hue family. A future PR that wants to swap back to
 *     warm primary for some other reason would need to update
 *     this ratchet AND argue against the cool/warm-cool design
 *     reasoning in the doc-comment.
