/**
 * kpi-glow-dim-08 (2026-05-15) — KPI card glow opacity multiplier.
 *
 * MetricCard's R17-PR4 corner glow used the gradient's natural
 * source alpha (`--brand-subtle` = 18% METRO / 9% PwC) at full
 * pseudo opacity (1.0). After the hero-glow tightening sweep
 * (#529 → #530 → #531 dropped the hero from animated 0.65↔1.0
 * down to a static 0.15) the KPI cards started reading as the
 * brightest surface on the dashboard.
 *
 * This PR multiplies the KPI glow by 0.8 via `before:opacity-[0.8]`
 * on MetricCard. Two invariants worth locking:
 *
 *   1. The multiplier is on the `::before` (where the glow lives),
 *      NOT the element. Putting it on the element would mute the
 *      label, value, and trend chip — those need full opacity.
 *
 *   2. The multiplier applies to BOTH default AND selected states
 *      (selected swaps the gradient source to `--brand-muted` at
 *      40%; with the 0.8 multiplier, selected and default both
 *      scale by the same factor, preserving the 2.22× visual
 *      hierarchy between them).
 *
 * The R17-PR4 / capstone gradient-shape ratchets are deliberately
 * left unchanged — they assert the radial-gradient string, not the
 * opacity wrapper. Dimming is a separate axis.
