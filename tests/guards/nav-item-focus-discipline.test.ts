/**
 * Roadmap-12 PR-7 — NavItem focus-visible (keyboard story) lock.
 *
 * Keyboard navigation is a first-class user. The focus signal has
 * to read as deliberate: a thin ring at the canonical brand tone,
 * floating one breath off the row, drawn whenever the keyboard
 * (not the mouse) is the input modality.
 *
 * Four tokens — no more, no less:
 *
 *   1. `focus-visible:outline-none`
 *      Suppress the user-agent default outline. The ring below
 *      replaces it with one we own.
 *
 *   2. `focus-visible:ring-2`
 *      2px ring. 1 is invisible on common hi-DPI, 3 reads as
 *      "alarm".
 *
 *   3. `focus-visible:ring-[var(--ring)]`
 *      Canonical focus tone — brand-tinted at low alpha (yellow
 *      ~55% in METRO theme, orange ~40% in PwC). The same token
 *      every focusable primitive uses. NEVER a hard brand fill.
 *
 *   4. `focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-bg-default`
 *      2px gap between the row and the ring, filled with the
 *      sidebar's `bg-bg-default` surface. The ring floats one
 *      breath off the row. That breath is what makes the focus
 *      state look DELIBERATE.
 *
 * What this ratchet does NOT police
 *
 *   - The exact alpha values inside `--ring`. The token's
 *     internal definition is a design-system decision.
 *   - `focus:` (without `-visible`) — that's a different
 *     concept (always-on when focused, including mouse). The
 *     ratchet asserts the recipe is `focus-visible:`, not just
 *     `focus:`.
