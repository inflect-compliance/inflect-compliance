/**
 * Mobile roadmap — capstone meta-ratchet ("guard the guards").
 *
 * The 5-PR mobile-friendliness roadmap (touch targets · responsive DataTable ·
 * viewport-safe popovers · dashboard stack · canvas fallback) each shipped a
 * structural guard. This capstone asserts every one of them still EXISTS and is
 * non-trivial, plus the responsive E2E spec carries its mobile coverage — so a
 * future PR can't quietly delete a mobile guard and let the regression class
 * back in. Mirrors the repo's other domain integrity ratchets
 * (ci-pipeline-integrity, verification-integrity, codebase-hygiene-integrity).
