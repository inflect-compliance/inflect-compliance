/**
 * Roadmap-9 PR-9 — primary:secondary ratio direction lock.
 *
 * Premium B2B products (Linear, Stripe, Vercel, Notion) render
 * roughly 3:1 to 4:1 secondary:primary across their app surface.
 * Primary is the rare, deliberate emphasis; secondary is the
 * everyday action tone.
 *
 * IC's ratio today after R8: 55 primary / 56 secondary in src/app
 * — close to 1:1. The R8 round dropped many primaries (Audits/
 * Evidence/Findings status flips, vendor + control form-toggles
 * before being reverted under create-button-uniformity, several
 * other targeted demotions), but the product is still loud at the
 * action layer.
 *
 * This ratchet locks the DIRECTION of travel, not the count:
 *
 *   1. Floor on the secondary:primary ratio. Today's ratio is
 *      ~1.02; the floor is 1.0 (secondary ≥ primary). The
 *      direction of travel is upward — future PRs that demote a
 *      primary to secondary push the ratio up; future PRs that
 *      promote a secondary to primary would push it back below
 *      1.0 and trip CI.
 *
 *   2. Ceiling on the absolute primary count. 55 today; budget
 *      at 56 (small headroom for legitimate new primaries that
 *      paid for themselves with a demotion in the same PR).
 *      Direction of travel — one-way down.
 *
 * The ratio assertion is the user-perceived quality lever; the
 * count ceiling is the structural ceiling. Together they make
 * "quiet by default" a one-way march without forcing per-PR
 * judgment.
 *
 * Pairs with `primary-action-budget.test.ts` (R7-PR1, per-file
 * cap) and `create-button-uniformity.test.ts` (v2-fu-2, visual
 * lock on `+ X` buttons). This ratchet sits at the round level —
 * primary-action-budget caps individual files; this caps the
 * product overall.
