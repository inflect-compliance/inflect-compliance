/**
 * Roadmap-8 PR-12 — round completion ratchet.
 *
 * The closing PR of the Visible Uplift Round. Locks the round's
 * artefacts so a future "cleanup" PR cannot silently delete one of
 * the ratchets and reopen the regression surface.
 *
 * Roadmap-8 shipped:
 *
 *   PR-1  inline-empty-state primitive            (build)
 *   PR-2  empty-state migration sweep             (drop PENDING_MIG to 0)
 *   PR-3  EntityDetailLayout sweep + ratchet smarting
 *   PR-4  metadata-strip ratchet correction       (track MetaStrip)
 *   PR-5  badge density ratchet + demotions
 *   PR-6  controls/[controlId] structural cleanup (10 → 7 primaries)
 *   PR-7  vendors/[vendorId] structural cleanup   (9 → 6 primaries)
 *   PR-8  DashboardLayout coverage registry
 *   PR-9  Coverage migration to DashboardLayout
 *   PR-10 FormField ratchet narrowing             (regex tightening)
 *   PR-11 PageActions / ActionCluster coverage    (lock primitives)
 *   PR-12 skeleton-pulse budget ratchet           (this PR)
 *
 * Pairs with R7's `roadmap-7-completion.test.ts` — same lock-the-
 * deliverables shape. Future deletions of an R8 ratchet that try
 * to "preserve greenness" by emptying ROADMAP_8_RATCHETS still
 * trip the size-≥-floor assertion.
