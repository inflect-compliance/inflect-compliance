/**
 * Behavioural-coverage registry — the convention that keeps a green
 * structural ratchet from being mistaken for a verified feature.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM (see `docs/frontend-assurance-model.md` and
 * `docs/roadmap-audit-2026-05-13.md`):
 *
 *   The repo has ~387 structural ratchets under `tests/guards/` and
 *   `tests/guardrails/`. Almost all are string/AST scans asserting a
 *   className or symbol is PRESENT in source. A green structural
 *   ratchet does NOT prove the feature works — the audit caught three
 *   cases in one week where it was green but the rendered result was
 *   wrong (the flagship: a nav active-band where the right token was
 *   in `className` but the rendered gradient was the wrong ramp).
 *
 * THE CONVENTION:
 *
 *   This guard carries a curated registry of HIGH-RISK primitives —
 *   primitives where a structural ratchet alone has been shown (or is
 *   judged likely) to miss a real regression because the wire-up
 *   between className and rendered effect is subtle. For every entry,
 *   this guard asserts a matching Tier-2 behavioural/rendered test
 *   file exists under `tests/rendered/`.
 *
 *   The registry is a ONE-WAY RATCHET. It starts with today's reality
 *   and only grows. Removing an entry, or pointing it at a test file
 *   that no longer exists, fails CI.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT a back-fill of all 387 ratchets. The audit explicitly
 * says "convert one ratchet per session". The registry is the curated
 * subset where the structural-vs-rendered gap actually bites — adding
 * to it is cheap, and a future contributor who ships a new high-risk
 * primitive adds a row here in the same PR, which forces the rendered
 * test to exist before merge.
 *
 * HOW TO ADD AN ENTRY:
 *   1. Write the Tier-2 rendered test in `tests/rendered/` — it MUST
 *      assert a computed/resolved/rendered value, not just a
 *      className substring (see `docs/frontend-assurance-model.md`,
 *      "The behavioural assertion rule").
 *   2. Add a row to REGISTRY below: the primitive, its structural
 *      ratchet (the cheap scan that is necessary-but-not-sufficient),
 *      the rendered test that verifies behaviour, and the
 *      regression class it guards against.
