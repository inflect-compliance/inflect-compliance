/**
 * Roadmap-6 PR-1 — animation vocabulary discipline.
 *
 * The product had drifted to FIVE animation tokens for variations
 * of "appearing":
 *
 *   animate-fadeIn         (CSS, 0.3s, opacity + translateY 8→0)  103×
 *   animate-fade-in        (Tailwind, 0.15s, pure opacity)          4×
 *   animate-slide-up-fade  (Tailwind, 0.2s, translateY 6→0+opacity) 3×
 *   animate-slideIn        (CSS, 0.3s, opacity + translateX -10→0)  2×
 *   animate-scale-in       (Tailwind, 0.15s, scale 0.95→1+opacity)  1×
 *
 * Five tokens for visually-similar effects produced two real
 * problems:
 *
 *   1. The eye registered the difference between sliding-from-left
 *      (`slideIn`) and rising-from-below (`fadeIn`) on master-detail
 *      panes — only two callsites used `slideIn`, so the product
 *      surface read as "almost coordinated, but moving."
 *
 *   2. `fadeIn` and `fade-in` are not aliases. They run at 0.3s vs
 *      0.15s with different transforms. Two near-identical names
 *      with different effects is a maintenance trap.
 *
 * What lands
 *
 *   `animate-slideIn` is retired. Two callsites (master-detail
 *   panes in `audits/AuditsClient` and `clauses/ClausesBrowser`)
 *   migrate to `animate-fadeIn`. The CSS `@keyframes slideIn` +
 *   `.animate-slideIn` rules are removed from `globals.css`.
 *
 * The surviving canonical set
 *
 *   - `animate-fadeIn`        — page-level + content enter (0.3s)
 *   - `animate-fade-in`       — overlay backdrop (opacity-only, 0.15s)
 *   - `animate-slide-up-fade` — popover / tooltip enter (0.2s)
 *   - `animate-scale-in`      — modal panel enter (0.15s)
 *   - `animate-pulse`         — skeletons (loading)
 *   - `animate-spin`          — spinners
 *
 *   `fadeIn` and `fade-in` survive as DISTINCT animations because
 *   they do different things — opacity-only (backdrop) vs
 *   opacity+translateY (content). The names are kept disambiguated
 *   by the dash convention (`fade-in` is Tailwind/lowercase-dashed,
 *   `fadeIn` is CSS/camelCase). Future contributors choose by
 *   intent: backdrop = `fade-in`; content = `fadeIn`.
 *
 * What this ratchet locks
 *
 *   No `.tsx` file under `src/` may use `animate-slideIn`. The
 *   visual was redundant with `animate-fadeIn`; one of them had
 *   to go.
 *
 * What this ratchet does NOT police
 *
 *   - The remaining 5 named animations (each used legitimately).
 *   - Custom `transition-*` declarations on individual elements.
 *   - `motion/` library imports — those compose motion via JS
 *     instead of named CSS animations.
