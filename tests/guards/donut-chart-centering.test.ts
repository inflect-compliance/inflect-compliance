/**
 * DonutChart centering — visx `<Pie>` children render-prop trap.
 *
 * Real-world bug (caught 2026-05-14, present since the R16-PR5
 * rebuild): the dashboard's Risk Distribution donut rendered as
 * a thin crescent in the top-left corner of its SVG box. All
 * three arcs were in the DOM with correct `d` geometry and
 * fills — they were just drawn around SVG (0,0) instead of the
 * box centre.
 *
 * Root cause: visx's `<Pie>` only honours its `top` / `left`
 * props in the DEFAULT render path. When a `children` render-
 * prop is supplied:
 *
 *   // node_modules/@visx/shape/lib/shapes/Pie.js
 *   if (children) return <>{children({ arcs, path, pie })}</>;
 *   return <Group top={top} left={left}>...</Group>;
 *
 * the component returns a bare Fragment and DROPS top/left.
 * d3-shape's arc generator emits origin-centred coordinates, so
 * without an explicit centring transform the whole pie sits at
 * the SVG corner.
 *
 * DonutChart uses the children render-prop form (it needs per-
 * arc hover-pop wrappers + gradient fills). So it MUST supply
 * its own centring `<g transform="translate(center,center)">`
 * around the `<Pie>`.
 *
 * Three load-bearing invariants:
 *
 *   1. A `<g transform={`translate(${center},${center})`}>`
 *      wraps the `<Pie>`. This is the centring transform visx
 *      would have applied itself in the non-children path.
 *
 *   2. The `<Pie>` does NOT receive `top` / `left` props. They
 *      are silently ignored in the children form — passing them
 *      only misleads the next reader into thinking centring is
 *      handled. (If a future visx upgrade DOES honour them in
 *      the children path, the explicit `<g>` + the prop would
 *      double-translate — so the prop must stay absent.)
 *
 *   3. The `<Pie>` is invoked with the children render-prop
 *      form (`<Pie ...>{(pie) => ...}</Pie>`). This is the whole
 *      reason the trap applies — the ratchet documents WHY the
 *      manual `<g>` is load-bearing rather than dead wrapping.
