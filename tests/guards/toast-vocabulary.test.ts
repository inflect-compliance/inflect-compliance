/**
 * Roadmap-2 PR-9 — toast vocabulary discipline.
 *
 * Sonner's `toast()` was imported and configured per call site —
 * duration, variant, position decided by the page. The Epic 67
 * undo pattern coexisted as a separate API the page author had to
 * know about. Toasts are the most-seen feedback surface in the
 * product, and they had the LEAST design discipline.
 *
 * After PR-9 there is one canonical hook (`useToast`) with four
 * named methods (`success`, `error`, `info`, `warning`) plus a
 * fifth (the undo pattern, separate hook). Locked durations,
 * locked variants. Pages call the right method and the design
 * decisions stay centralized.
 *
 * What this ratchet locks in
 *   1. The `useToast()` hook exists at the canonical path with
 *      the four named methods + dismiss.
 *   2. No file outside the curated `SONNER_PRIMITIVE_FILES`
 *      allowlist imports `from 'sonner'`. The allowlist contains
 *      ONLY the canonical seam: the Toaster mount in providers,
 *      the `useToast` hook itself, and the two undo-pattern
 *      modules that wrap sonner's primitives in their own way.
 *
 * Future toast surfaces extend this ratchet by adding to the
 * allowlist with a written reason, or — preferably — by routing
 * through `useToast`.
