/**
 * Roadmap-13 PR-8 — Press feedback (the one allowed transform).
 *
 * The R12 motion-language rule was "opacity + colour only — no
 * transform / scale / translate". R13-PR8 consciously broadens
 * that rule by one element: the row drops 1px on mousedown
 * (`active:translate-y-px`), the universal "you just pressed
 * something physical" cue.
 *
 * Why this single broadening is worth the cost:
 *
 *   - Every R12 lift / hover-scale was banned because it composed
 *     poorly with the band + label motion language. The mousedown
 *     press is a transient (~50ms) micro-motion, not a sustained
 *     hover lift — it doesn't interfere with the band's 200ms
 *     opacity transition or the shimmer's 4s pulse.
 *
 *   - The user explicitly asked for "more clickable, more
 *     inevitable" buttons. Inset shadow (PR-7) gives static
 *     concavity; the press gives the transient click reward.
 *     Without the press, the row feels glossy but inert — the
 *     same fingertip that pressed a Mac button or an iOS row
 *     expects this feedback.
 *
 *   - Restricted to `active:` (CSS `:active`) — fires only during
 *     mousedown. `hover:translate-*` is still banned by the
 *     global motion-language ratchet for everyone except this
 *     file.
 *
 * Three pieces, each invariant-checked here:
 *
 *   1. `active:translate-y-px` is wired in NAV_ITEM_BASE.
 *   2. `motion-reduce:active:translate-y-0` is the OS-preference
 *      safety net.
 *   3. `transition-transform duration-75 ease-out` makes the
 *      down-press snappy.
 *
 * Also locks the motion-language exempt: nav-item.tsx is the 6th
 * exempt file. The exempt count is bumped from 5 → 6 in the same
 * diff; the comment in motion-language-discipline.test.ts
 * documents the broadening rationale.
