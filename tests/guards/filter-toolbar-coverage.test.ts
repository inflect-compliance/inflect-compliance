/**
 * Roadmap-7 PR-4 — FilterToolbar coverage ratchet.
 *
 * Heavy entity-level list pages — Risks, Vendors, Audits, Frameworks
 * (templates), Tasks, Evidence, Controls — wear `<FilterToolbar>` so
 * search, faceted filters, view-toggle, and primary action sit in
 * the same order, with the same spacing, on every page. New pages
 * mounting `<DataTable>` should reach for `<FilterToolbar>` before
 * inventing their own toolbar chrome.
 *
 * The ratchet enforces that any file mounting `<DataTable>` either
 * also mounts `<FilterToolbar>` OR appears in EXEMPTIONS with a
 * written reason describing why the page legitimately doesn't need
 * faceted filters. Today's exemption list captures the empirical
 * pattern after surveying production: cross-tenant read-only
 * aggregation tables, admin sub-pages with one fixed entity-type
 * and inline controls, wizards, dashboard composites, and detail-
 * tab sub-tables.
 *
 * The direction of travel: this list shrinks as pages organically
 * gain faceted filtering. New pages added to the codebase should
 * either mount FilterToolbar or land in this list with reasoning —
 * never bypass silently.
