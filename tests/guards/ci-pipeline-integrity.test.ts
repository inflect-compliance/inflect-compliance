/**
 * CI/CD pipeline-integrity capstone — the meta-ratchet.
 *
 * Four remediations hardened the build / test / release pipeline:
 *
 *   1. Dependency-install integrity — strict peer resolution
 *      (`no-legacy-peer-deps`) + deterministic `npm ci` installs
 *      (`deterministic-install`).
 *   2. E2E test isolation — fixture-scoped tenants, no cross-test
 *      `let` cascade (`e2e-isolation`).
 *   3. Staging smoke gate — production deploy `needs: smoke-staging`
 *      (`deploy-staging-gate`) + the OI-2 helm invariants
 *      (`deploy-workflow`).
 *   4. Build / env-validation discipline — the CI build skips
 *      compile-time env validation deliberately; runtime is the
 *      real gate.
 *
 * Each of 1–3 shipped its OWN structural guardrail. THIS test
 * guards the guards: it fails CI if any of those guardrail files is
 * deleted or gutted to a no-op, so a future "simplify the tests"
 * change cannot quietly dismantle the protection. It also locks the
 * build/env-validation posture (item 4).
 *
 * Make the safe path the default path: a contributor who removes a
 * pipeline guardrail must reckon with a red meta-ratchet, not a
 * silently weakened pipeline.
 *
 * See docs/ci-cd-pipeline-integrity.md.
