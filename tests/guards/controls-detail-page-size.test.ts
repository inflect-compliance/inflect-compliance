/**
 * Elevation PR-2 — controls/[controlId] page-size ratchet.
 *
 * The control detail page is the largest in the codebase and a
 * known velocity tax. Polish PR-2 began the decomposition by
 * extracting the Edit Control modal into `_modals/`. This ratchet
 * locks the line count at the current value so future PRs:
 *   - cannot ADD inline content to the page (forced to extract
 *     instead), AND
 *   - are encouraged to extract more (the FLOOR can drop monotonically
 *     as more sub-components are pulled out).
 *
 * To bump the floor down (good — page shrank): adjust MAX_LINES to
 * the new line count of the file in the same diff that does the
 * extraction. To bump the floor up (bad — page grew): the ratchet
 * fails CI and asks the author to extract or delete content
 * elsewhere instead.
 *
 * The eventual target is ≤ 300 lines (page coordinates, doesn't
 * implement). This is multi-PR work — track in
 * docs/implementation-notes/2026-05-09-controls-page-decomposition.md
 * (future).

// Adjust DOWNWARD as the page shrinks. The single allowable upward
// nudge happens when a deliberate platform-wide primitive adoption

// MetaStrip primitive across all detail pages, +42 lines net here).
// Anything else MUST shrink the page or extract a sub-component
// instead.
//
// R8-PR2 raised by 20 (1430 → 1450) to accommodate the
// InlineEmptyState migration on four tab-body empty states (Tasks /
// Evidence / Frameworks / Activity). Each call expands from a
// one-line inline `<div className="p-8 text-center
// text-content-subtle text-sm">No X yet</div>` to a 4-line
// `<InlineEmptyState title=... description=...>` block. Visual
// uniformity gain is real; line cost is the trade.
//
// R11-PR6 raised by 60 (1450 → 1510) to accommodate the
// raw-<table> → <DataTable> migration of the tasks sub-table.
// Inline ColumnDef<ControlTaskDTO>[] block is ~70 lines but
// replaces ~28 lines of raw <tr>/<td> markup, net +42 + import +
// useMemo wrapping. Visual uniformity (tasks table now matches
// every other table in the product) is the trade.
//
// #102 item 1 lowered by 106 (1510 → 1404): the tab-lazy refactor
// added per-tab `useTenantSWR` reads + loading states (~+60), then
// extracted the whole Mappings tab — state, effects, map/unmap
// handlers and JSX — into `_tabs/ControlMappingsTab.tsx` (~-165 net
// on the page). A genuine downward ratchet: the page shrank below
// every prior floor.
