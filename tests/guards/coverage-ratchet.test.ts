/**
 * Coverage ratchet — the enforced floors are one-way-up.
 *
 * `jest.thresholds.json` holds the per-layer coverage floors that
 * the CI `Coverage (≥60%)` job enforces via `--coverageThreshold`.
 * The policy (`docs/coverage-policy.md`) is that a floor is **never
 * lowered** — raised when a PR earns it, never dropped to turn a
 * red PR green. `jest.config.js` documents that rule in prose; this
 * test ENFORCES it.
 *
 * `RATCHET_FLOOR` below is the hard minimum. Every value in
 * `jest.thresholds.json` must be greater than or equal to it — a
 * threshold lowered below the floor fails CI loudly, which is
 * exactly the regression (GAP-02: "lower a floor to make CI green")
 * this guard exists to catch.
 *
 * When a PR RAISES a threshold (the ratchet moving up), a value
 * above the floor already passes — bumping the matching
 * `RATCHET_FLOOR` entry to lock the gain harder is encouraged but
 * not required. `RATCHET_FLOOR` is only ever edited UPWARD: a
 * downward edit here is itself the reviewed, deliberate act of
 * retiring a floor, never a drive-by.
 *
 * Pure static analysis — reads `jest.thresholds.json`, no coverage
 * run, no DB.

    //     (dashboard aggregator + consistency-check + RBAC + 3 not-
    //     found paths).
    // Combined ~143 covered branches. Conservative +1 across all
    // metrics after stages 3d/3e showed the broader-tree dilution
    // (a dense file contributes ~0.5-1% absolute on the tree).
    // Stage 3g (#672): 40 tests across THREE files —
    //   - `soft-delete-lifecycle.ts` (143 lines): file-level
    //     **100/100/100/100** (perfect). 4 fns, 6 throw guards.
    //   - `vendor-assessment-reminder.ts` (129 lines): file-level

    //   - `org-dashboard-widgets.ts` (225 lines): file-level

    // (matches stage 3f's broader-tree-dilution pattern).
    // Stage 3h (this wave): 54 tests across FIVE small files in
    // one PR. `control/page-data.ts` was dropped from the original
    // candidate list (already at 100/94/100/100); replaced with
