/**
 * Roadmap-5 PR-10 — border-tone budget.
 *
 * The product had no clear default border tone:
 *   • `border-border-default` × 133
 *   • `border-border-subtle`  × 113
 *
 * 50/50 split with no documented rule. Most structural lines
 * read better at the quieter tone — `border-border-default` is
 * a stronger signal than the average border deserves.
 *
 * Policy (locked here, also documented in CLAUDE.md)
 *
 *   subtle    — DEFAULT border tone for structural separators
 *               (form-field outlines, table-cell separators,
 *               quiet panel boundaries, sidebar item dividers).
 *               If you have to ask "default or subtle?", the
 *               answer is subtle.
 *
 *   default   — Reserved for surfaces that need explicit
 *               containment: card outer border, table outer
 *               border, modal/sheet boundary, popover/tooltip
 *               outline. The "this is a discrete surface"
 *               statement.
 *
 *   emphasis  — Reserved for state: selected card, active panel,
 *               focused field, hovered click target, error /
 *               warning state's border.
 *
 * What this ratchet locks
 *
 *   The total `border-border-default` count under
 *   `src/app` + `src/components` may NOT exceed today's count.
 *   New uses force net-down migrations elsewhere — the budget
 *   only ratchets DOWN.
 *
 *   This is the "freeze the regression boundary" strategy.
 *   The full migration to subtle-by-default happens in
 *   incremental follow-up PRs that bring the count down rung
 *   by rung. Each follow-up PR drops the budget number here.
 *
 * What this ratchet does NOT police
 *
 *   - Per-site choice between subtle / default / emphasis.
 *     That's a judgement call by the contributor; the policy
 *     above guides it but isn't structurally enforced.
 *
 *   - The 113 existing `border-border-subtle` sites — those
 *     read correctly today and don't need touching.
 *
 *   - Other border tokens (`border-border-emphasis`,
 *     `border-border-error`, `border-border-warning`, …) —
 *     those carry semantic state and aren't subject to this
 *     budget.

/**
 * Locked at the count when this ratchet landed
 * (Roadmap-5 PR-10, 2026-05-10). Future PRs that migrate
 * `border-border-default` → `border-border-subtle` MUST
 * decrement this number to lock in the win.
 *
 * Roadmap-7 PR-2 (2026-05-10) lowered the budget from 133 → 120 by
 * migrating form-field outlines (input / textarea), filter-primitive
 * resting borders, internal popover dividers, and kbd-shortcut hints
 * from `default` to `subtle` — the documented default tone for
 * structural separators.
 *
 * R13-PR6 (2026-05-11) lowered the budget from 120 → 119 by
 * dropping `cardVariants(...)` wrappers around three admin/reports
 * DataTables (integrations, notifications, reports skeleton). The
 * outer cards carried `border-border-default/50` strip-dividers
 * inside their card-header — those went away with the wrappers.
 *
 * R13-PR10 (2026-05-11) lowered the budget from 119 → 118 by
 * deleting `admin/AdminClient.tsx` (audit log moved to its own
 * page) — its policy-templates branch carried a
 * `border border-border-default` divider on the template tiles.
 *
 * Future PRs continue to ratchet down toward the rough 4:1
 * subtle-to-default target ratio.
