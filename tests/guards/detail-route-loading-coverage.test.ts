/**
 * Instant-navigation guard — every dynamic detail route ships a `loading.tsx`.
 *
 * A detail route is a `[param]` directory containing a `page.tsx`. Without a
 * sibling `loading.tsx`, navigating to it shows a BLANK screen until the
 * server resolves the page data (the App Router has no instant boundary to
 * fall back to) — the single worst perceived-latency offender the perf audit
 * found (11 routes were blank). A `loading.tsx` renders an instant skeleton.
 *
 * This locks the fix: a new detail route can't ship without a skeleton.
