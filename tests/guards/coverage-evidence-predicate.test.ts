/**
 * Guardrail: coverage-evidence predicate unification (ep1 evidence review gate).
 *
 * ─── The invariant ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Evidence that counts toward framework coverage / audit readiness" has
 * exactly ONE definition — `isCoverageQualifyingEvidence` /
 * `coverageQualifyingEvidenceWhere` in
 * `src/lib/compliance/coverage-evidence.ts`: APPROVED, not archived,
 * not soft-deleted, and unexpired.
 *
 * Before this PR four scorer sites disagreed. The worst offender counted
 * `status: { in: ['SUBMITTED', 'APPROVED'] }`, so a merely-SUBMITTED
 * (un-reviewed) piece of evidence silently satisfied a control's
 * coverage gate — approval was not load-bearing.
 *
 * This ratchet locks the unification. For each scorer file it asserts:
 *   1. it imports from `@/lib/compliance/coverage-evidence` (so the
 *      shared predicate is actually wired, not re-inlined);
 *   2. (comments stripped) it contains no `SUBMITTED` literal — the
 *      canary for a re-introduced inline status set that would let
 *      un-approved evidence count again;
 *   3. it contains no `status: { in: [` fragment — the shape the old
 *      inline evidence filter used.
 *
 * A future "optimisation" that re-inlines an evidence status filter
 * trips this test in the same diff.
