/**
 * Roadmap-2 PR-2 — top-chrome discipline (PR-11 simplification).
 *
 * The chrome is the load-bearing premium-feel surface added in
 * this roadmap pass. Three things must remain true for the
 * affordance to keep working as the codebase evolves:
 *
 *   1. The shell mounts the chrome AND wraps its children in the
 *      breadcrumbs provider. Without the provider the
 *      `useBreadcrumbs` hook falls back to a silent no-op and the
 *      chrome renders an empty trail forever.
 *   2. The chrome mounts both canonical regions: breadcrumbs
 *      (left) + identity pill (right). The center search-anchor
 *      was retired in PR-11 — the sidebar's inline command opener
 *      (PR-3) is the canonical search affordance. A future PR
 *      that removes EITHER remaining region collapses the
 *      chrome's contract — ratchet fails so the diff is loud.
 *   3. `<PageHeader>` pushes its breadcrumbs into the context.
 *      Removing this call (e.g. "let pages call useBreadcrumbs
 *      directly") would silently break every existing page that
 *      passes breadcrumbs to the page header.
 *
 * What this ratchet does NOT police
 *   The unauth/print surfaces (login, error, no-tenant, not-found,
 *   SoAPrintView) intentionally render outside `<AppShell>` and
 *   therefore have no chrome. They never call `useBreadcrumbs`
 *   either, so the context's silent no-op is the desired
 *   behaviour there.
