/**
 * Roadmap-7 PR-7 — FormField coverage ratchet.
 *
 * 28 source files in `src/app` mount raw `<label>` tags directly
 * instead of routing through the `<FormField>` primitive. The
 * primitive owns the field's vertical rhythm — label, optional
 * description, control, optional error — with one set of paddings,
 * one weight, one focus contract. Hand-rolled labels drift across
 * pages: spacing, label styling, error placement, all per-page.
 *
 * The number is a ceiling. Any new file in `src/app` that mounts a
 * raw `<label>` increases the count and fails the ratchet. The
 * direction of travel is one-way down: as files migrate to
 * `<FormField>`, the budget number drops in lockstep.
 *
 * Why a budget rather than a coverage list:
 *   - 28 files is too many to list per-site with notes today.
 *     Maintaining the registry would be more friction than the
 *     migrations themselves.
 *   - The ceiling is binary: any NEW <label> trips the ratchet,
 *     forcing the contributor to use FormField.
 *   - Migration PRs drop the budget number to lock the win — the
 *     same shape as `border-tone-budget.test.ts` (R5-PR10).
 *
 * Excludes:
 *   - The FormField primitive itself (it legitimately renders a
 *     <label> internally).
 *   - <Label> primitive that wraps <label> with token styling.
 *   - Any compound widget that needs a click-to-label region for
 *     accessibility (custom checkboxes wrapping their <label>).
 *     None today; if added, allowlist by file path.
