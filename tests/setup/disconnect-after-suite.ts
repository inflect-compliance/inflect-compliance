/**
 * Global `afterAll` hook — release long-lived Prisma connections at
 * the end of every test file.
 *
 * Two singletons need to come down:
 *   1. `prismaTestClient()` from `tests/helpers/db.ts` — the
 *      integration-test client.
 *   2. `prisma` from `src/lib/prisma.ts` — the app-layer singleton.
 *      Any test that imports a usecase / repository reaches through
 *      to this client, which holds a Postgres pool open until
 *      explicitly disconnected.
 *
 * Without both, Jest workers exit via `forceExit: true` with the
 * "A worker process has failed to exit gracefully" warning.
 *
 * Registered via the node project's `setupFilesAfterEnv` so it runs
 * exactly once per test file. Both calls are no-ops when the
 * underlying client was never materialised (pure-mock tests).
