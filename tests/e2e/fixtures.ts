/**
 * Playwright fixtures for declarative per-spec test isolation.
 *
 * The default `@playwright/test` `test` object logs every mutating
 * spec into the SAME seeded `acme-corp` tenant (`DEFAULT_USER`).
 * Two mutating specs that write to that shared tenant can pollute
 * each other and create order-dependence — a failed setup step in
 * one spec cascades into unrelated specs.
 *
 * This module extends `test` with two fixtures so a mutating spec
 * gets a FRESH, EMPTY tenant of its own:
 *
 *   - `isolatedTenant` — a `IsolatedTenantCredentials` provisioned
 *     via `createIsolatedTenant()`. Test-scoped: every `test()` in
 *     the spec gets its own brand-new tenant, so a write in one
 *     test can never be observed by — let alone break — another.
 *
 *   - `authedPage` — the standard `page` fixture, already signed in
 *     as the `isolatedTenant`'s OWNER and parked on
 *     `/t/<slug>/dashboard`. The common case: a mutating spec that
 *     wants "a logged-in browser on a clean tenant" with zero
 *     boilerplate.
 *
 * Usage (mutating spec):
 * ```ts
 * import { test, expect } from './fixtures';
 *
 * test('create a control', async ({ authedPage, isolatedTenant }) => {
 *     await authedPage.goto(`/t/${isolatedTenant.tenantSlug}/controls/new`);
 *     // …the tenant is empty; create what you need here.
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Read-only specs (list pages, a11y, theme, tooltips, responsive,
 * filter chrome) do NOT use this module — they keep importing
 * `@playwright/test` directly and log into the shared seeded tenant
 * via `loginAndGetTenant`, because they NEED the seed data and
 * read-only access cannot cascade.
 *
 * The underlying primitives — `createIsolatedTenant`, `signInAs` —
 * stay in `e2e-utils.ts`. This file is purely the fixture wiring on
 * top of them; nothing here knows about the register route or the
 * tenant tracker.
 *
 * Why test-scoped (not worker-scoped): a worker-scoped tenant would
 * be shared by every test the worker runs, re-introducing exactly
 * the cross-test pollution this work removes. Test-scoped costs one
 * extra `/api/auth/register` round-trip per test (~1-2 s) — cheap
 * insurance against order-dependence. Specs that genuinely want one
 * tenant for a whole serial scenario can still call
 * `createIsolatedTenant` once in a `beforeAll` (see `responsive` /
 * `onboarding` / `theme-toggle`); the fixture is the per-test
 * default, not the only option.
 */
/*
 * The Playwright fixture callback's second parameter is `use` by
 * convention. The `react-hooks` ESLint plugin mistakes it for
 * React's `use()` hook and flags `rules-of-hooks` — a false
 * positive: this file imports nothing from React and runs only in
 * the Playwright (Node) test runner. Disable the rule file-wide.
