/**
 * Build the standalone BullMQ worker + scheduler entrypoints.
 *
 * The worker and scheduler run as separate processes from the
 * Next.js server (see `docker-compose.prod.yml` `worker` service).
 * The production image is dev-dependency-pruned, so it cannot run
 * the TypeScript sources directly via `tsx`. This script bundles
 * each entrypoint — with all its `src/` imports inlined — into a
 * single self-contained `.mjs` file under `dist/`. node_modules
 * stay external (resolved at runtime from the pruned production
 * `node_modules`), so every package the bundle imports MUST be a
 * production `dependency`, not a `devDependency`.
 *
 * Output: `dist/worker.mjs`, `dist/scheduler.mjs`.
 * Run:    `node scripts/build-worker.mjs`  (npm script: `build:worker`)
