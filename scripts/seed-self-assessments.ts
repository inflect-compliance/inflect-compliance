/**
 * Standalone, idempotent seeder for the onboarding SELF-ASSESSMENT library
 * content — the NIS2 gap-assessment and AI-governance question sets.
 *
 * Why this exists as its own script (not just `prisma/seed.ts`):
 * these question sets live in dedicated global reference tables
 * (`Nis2GapDomain`/`Nis2GapQuestion`, `AiGovDomain`/`AiGovQuestion`) that are
 * populated by the fixtures, NOT by migrations. Migrations create the tables;
 * they carry no data. `prisma/seed.ts` DOES seed them, but the full seed also
 * provisions demo tenants/users and is unsafe to run against production. When
 * these question sets were added after the initial prod seed, the tables stayed
 * empty and the wizard's self-assessment steps rendered zero questions.
 *
 * This script seeds ONLY the two global question sets, via upsert, so it is safe
 * to run on any environment (including production) and safe to re-run. Run with:
 *   tsx scripts/seed-self-assessments.ts        (npm run db:seed-self-assessments)
